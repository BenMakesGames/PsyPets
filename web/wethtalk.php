Turning around puts you face to face with one of the several scientists working here.  A quick glance at his name tag identifies him as Seth Tagle.</p>     <p>"Excuse me, <?= $user['display'] ?>?  Could I talk to you for a moment?"  He motions to a small office room on the far wall.</p>     <p>He lets you go first, stopping to say something to one of the receptionists.  You strain your ears to listen in on the conversation as you sit down in the office.  You only barely manage to make out Seth's voice:</p>     <p>"Van, can you let Dr. Heidel know that we have another WeTH exposure.  Yeah.  <?= $user['display'] ?>.  Thanks."</p>     <p>You lean back in the chair, trying to look like you weren't listening in on the conversation, as Seth enters and takes a seat across from you.</p>     <p>"Don't worry, you're not in trouble or anything.  Look, I'll explain it situation as directly as I can:  You obviously got your hands on one of those WeTH cards.  It's a computer board that we've been designing, and, well, it's not supposed to exist yet.  It hasn't ever been actually made, yet clearly there are several of them out there already.  A WeTH Blueprint must have been leaked, but we don't know for sure.</p>     <p>"I'm not going to question you about it, or anything.  Everyone says the same thing anyway: 'I just saw it in the Giving Tree', or 'It appeared in my Post Office box', or whatever.  Someone's out there distributing these things, and we know it's not the residents' fault.</p>     <p>"The WeTH isn't really dangerous, or anything.  Just, the physics behind it... well it's too complicated to get in to.  Space-time, and lasers, and it'll all sound like something from a sci-fi novel if I try to explain it.  Just don't leave it in direct sunlight, or bring it in contact with water while it's on.  You know, sensible stuff like that.</p>     <p>"Our primary concern is that the design is out, and there's a lot of potential behind it.  I mean, remember Einstein came up with his famous equation without realizing that atom bombs might be created as a result.  Let's just say the consequences of the WeTH are less ambiguous.</p>     <p>"Anyway, look, the damage is already done: it's out there.  Someone's going to sell it to someone else for a lot of money, if they haven't already, and there's nothing we can do about it at this point, so trying to confiscate the things isn't going to help any.  We just want you to be aware of what's going on, and, though again I'm sure it's fine, to be careful with the WeTH.</p>     <p>"And... I guess that's it.  Sorry if I startled you, asking you to step in here to talk," he stands up and pushes in the chair.  "I'll let you get back to your business."</p>     <ul>      <li><a href="cityhall.php">Back to the City Hall message board</a></li>     </ul><?php include 'commons/footer_2.php'; ?> </body></html>

<p>Hello.  I'm Eve Heidel, HERG Director.</p>
<p>HERG, founded by my husband in 2004, was established to study the Hollow Earth, and the curious creatures native to it, which we have dubbed "PsyPets".</p>
<p>Their ability to learn is nothing short of astonishing.  Since coming here, PsyPets have learned to do everything from painting and sculpting to chemistry and electrical engineering!</p>
<p>To study these creatures in detail we rely on volunteer help from people such as yourself.  We provide a place for you to live, and even a little spending money.</p>
<p>Interested in signing up?</p>

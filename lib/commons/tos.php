<h4>Terms of Service</h4>
<p>These Terms of Service may be changed at any time.  If/when they are, PsyPets will require you to read and agree to them to continue using the site.</p>
<h5>People Who May Play</h5>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a> tells me that players under the age of 13 may not sign up for PsyPets.  Sorry :(</p>
<p>Everyone else: hop aboard!</p>
<h5>Things You Must Do</h5>
<h6>Obey The Law</h6>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Don't post/link to illegally-distributed software, music, etc.</li>
 <li>Don't post/link to porn.  (We're not all 18+ here, and despite how old someone says they are, you don't know for sure.)</li>
</ul>
<h6>Be Mature and Respectful of Other Players</h6>
<p>Implications of this rule include, but are not limited to: don't troll, flame, or spam.</p>
<p>Swearing is not forbidden, but is best when used thoughtfully.</p>
<h6>Report Bugs</h6>
<p>Sometimes bugs mess you up; sometimes they help you (which messes up other people).  Regardless, they're damaging to the game.  Help make PsyPets awesome! :)</p>
<h6>Keep Your E-mail Address Up To Date</h6>
<p>If there's trouble with your account, it's the only way PsyPets can get in contact with you.</p>
<ul><li>See also: <a href="/meta/privacy.php">Privacy Policy</a>.</li></ul>
<h5>Some Helpful Rules of Thumb</h5>
<p>Be a good person.  Be responsible.  "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."  Remember what you learned in kindergarten.</p>
<h5>Legal Business</h5>
<p>Your accounts (and their items, pets, etc) are property of <a href="http://benmakesgames.com">BenMakesGames</a>.  (With this in mind, some players like to buy/sell promises for in-game actions, such as exchanging items or control of an account.  This is not recommended, as it is easy to be scammed; do so at your own risk!)</p>
<p>It is the right of the admin to deny a player access to PsyPets for any reason (especially for repeatedly ignoring the above rules).</p>

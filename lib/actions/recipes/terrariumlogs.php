<p>I finished my Science Fair project!  I call it the "Arbitrarium Terrarium!"  Ha, ha!</p>
<p>I thought it was a really cool name, but my teacher disagreed... whatever - it's my entry, so I'm gonna submit it as the "Arbitrarium Terrarium!"</p>
<p>The hardest part was getting a good light source for it, but a friend of mine recommended some Pyrestone.  I didn't know, but apparently they give off a lot of ultraviolet light, which the plants love.  Other than that, though, it was just a bunch of glass and plastic to make the cage.  Oh, and I took an on/off switch out of a remote-control car I had lying around.</p>
<p>But man, that Pyrestone stuff is really expensive!  I better place well, or all those moneys will have been wasted!</p>
<p>Well, it still grows some neat stuff, though, so I guess not <em>completely</em> wasted...  Yesterday I pulled a Tomato, and I think I saw the leaves of an Aging Root sprouting up!  It's hard to tell.</p>
<p>P.S. "Black, Yellow, Black" was <em>really</em> useful!</p>

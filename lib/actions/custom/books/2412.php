<span style="font-weight:bold;">Ctofine</span>:<br />
&quot;&quot;I have no idea ...&quot; said Harper again.<br />
<br />
Just then, a loud scratching on the door distracted them all. &quot;Sccreeech...scratch....meowp?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like Chica wants to come in!&quot; exclaimed Harper. &quot;Maybe she's here to pick up Mr. PotatoHead for ctofine!&quot;<br />
<br />
Poking her head through the much too small cat door, Chica meowped, &quot;Lemme in! I've got to pick up that Spud!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising an eyebrow, Harper opened the door. &quot;Well, then, come on in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank ya'....I will!&quot; grinned Chica. &quot;Sorry it took me so long, ctofine and I have been prepping food for a local wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
*horrified stares all around*<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...NO...she doesn't want the Spud for food! &quot; guffawed Chica. &quot;These folks are allergic to potatoes! Ctofine just wants to visit with Mr. P. and find out what kind of delicacies he's had in his travels!&quot;<br />
<br />
So, the group of pixel-pals took the sign down, and Chica helped to lug the Spud out the door. &quot;Chipoltina wants to talk to the Spud next, &quot; meowped Chica. <br />
<br />
And, thus, that is how Mr. PotatoHead ended up on a train platform waiting to be picked up (and hopefully not picked apart) by Chipoltina.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Chipoltina</span>:<br />
&quot;Chipoltina and Pooky idle up to the train station in her Speck (transportation run solely on feathers and 3-leaf clovers because I have so damn many!). Chipoltina hops out of the car and onto the train platform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mr. Potatohead, I like you, too, but you caused a spot of trouble with some of my plushies last time! I'm just here to guide you to Rob1969's house.<br />
<br />
Chipoltina waits with Mr. P until a train on the other side of the platform arrives. She bundles him onto the train and hops back into the car with Pooky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew, Pooks! He needs to cause trouble somewhere else....&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Rob1969</span>:<br />
&quot;well Mr Potatohead showed up at my doorstep looking tattered and tired. I thought I might let him rest in my playroom with my plushies, couches, and televisions. This morning I wandered into the playroom only to find the horny little fellow humping my Hamster Plushy..<br />
<br />
I said &quot;thats it you are no longer welcome in this house..GET OUT&quot; He proceeded to somehow give me his little french fry middle finger and ran out..He said something about going to Night Auditor's house and looking for other plushies to violate...<br />
<br />
He is no longer welcome in my happy home....<br />
<br />
Happy Trails!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Night Auditor</span>:<br />
&quot;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br />
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
&quot; 'Tis some visitor,&quot; I muttered, &quot;tapping at my chamber door;<br />
Only this, and nothing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah it's Mr. Potatoehead, and nothing more. So I welcomed him in and show him around but he seemed despondent and quite bored. Hmm I guess being at everyones house here is psypets must all be the same. So I came up with an idea that Mr. Potatoehead and I should have ourselves a night on the town, Washington D.C. that is. <br />
<br />
I showed him the Capital and the Monument, also the Library of Congress and Lincoln's Head. He was very happy and showered me with affection to see such wonders and amazements. He told me of his land and the many different places he has been. I decided after such a busy day of touring it was time to eat. So I took him to McCormick &amp; Schmick's Seafood restaurant off of K st. in Northwest. I have never seen a potatoe eat seafood, but he seemed to love the fresh swordfish. <br />
<br />
After all this I asked. &quot;Are ready for night on the town.&quot; With a loud blech and smile from potatoe ear to potatoe ear he said &quot;You bet.&quot; So I took him to an underground rave with lasers and lights of every color imaginable. He was given glow sticks and beads galore. He danced like no potatoe ever before. Later on after some drinks he headed off with a couple of Raver girls to my hotel where I work at. I stayed downstairs and worked all night and in the morning gave him a wake-up call saying &quot;Mr. Potatoehead it is time to go.&quot; Three hours later he came down to check out. The Raver Girls each gave him a kiss and their numbers. I gave him a sly wink.  Then I sent him in a taxi to Union Station to go to Potatoe-san's house because who better to take care of him than a person with Potatoe in her name.  <br />
<br />
Thank You everyone for letting me take care of Mr. Potatoehead. &quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Potatoe-san</span>:<br />
&quot;Ding Dong. Potatoe comes to the door. Mr.PotatoeHead head is sitting on the doorstep with his bags. <br />
<br />
&quot;welcome Mr.PotatoeHead. My name is Potatoe&quot; <br />
Potatoe picks him up and takes him to his car. <br />
&quot;Come on Mr. PotatoeHead, lets go see the Tacoma Dome.&quot;<br />
Potatoe and Potato wander threw the Tacoma Dome parking lot. Today is the RV/ Boat show. Potato sits in the rear of the boat. Potatoe snaps a picture and they continue to wander. <br />
&quot;Mr.PotatoeHead, would you like to go see Space Needle?&quot;<br />
Potatoe and Potato wander off towards seattle. Today there is a fair. <br />
&quot;Lets go get on the Tornado Ride.&quot;<br />
Swirling and Swaying, Potatoe and Potato twist and turn on the Torado ride. After that they went towards the space needle. <br />
&quot;Come on Potatoe, lets go up and see.&quot;<br />
They stood perched upon the narrow looking dock. There was a steel cage Wrapped around for safty. As it darkened, Potatoe and Potato Went back to Potatoes house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well Potato, I had a good time today. I hope you had a good time. I think you'll have lots of fun with Koka! you have a long trip ahead of you.&quot;<br />
Potatoe Picks up Mr.PotatoeHead,walks down stairs and puts him on Kokas bed afte placing a gas mask on Potato so it dosent suffocate in sock smell.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Night Auditor</span>:<br />
&quot;I was sitting in my house today just drinking some rum &amp; coke, while my pets kept running around the house. When there was a knock on my door. &quot;Hello&quot; Oh it is Mr. Potatoehead again. Ha Ha he loves me.  They say that if you let someone you love go, and they come back they are yours forever (or something like that). In my soul I know that Mr. Potatoehead really loves me. Anyways I gave him a drink and we all sat down and ate dinner. He told me about all the drama from the last three houses he was at. <br />
I told him &quot;I will try to find you a nice quite house this time.&quot; So I sent him to Gymmaddie.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Gymmaddie</span>:<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, my house was anything but quiet. <br />
Nickelle joined our family yesterday, and I was unaware at the time of adoption that he had some behavior issues. As a punishment for urinating in our neighbor's yard, Nickelle was ordered to clean out the basement, first taking out anything under 5 units of space, and putting in everything over 5 units of space. <br />
Unfortunately, due to recent activities, Mr. Potatohead has acquired a bit of weight, causing him to weigh in at around 6 units of space. Carelessly finishing up his chore, Nickelle tossed Mr. Potatohead into the basement along with a few Unreasonably Large Swords. Mr Potatohead was found hours later, now nothing more than potato wedges in critical condition. <br />
The ambulance was called out, and Gymmaddie was cited for reckless child endangerment. Fortunately, Mr. Potatohead is now in stable condition, and in one piece. <br />
He is expected to be well enough to be transfered to the local hospital of Moon Cat by tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Moon Cat</span>:<br />
Mr potatohead appeared at our door earlier today.<br />
He looked somewhat worse for wear, but oh well.. what a potato does in his own time is his own business.<br />
<br />
Marishi-Ten, who was leading a hunting party, ran past his as he entered, she was carrying a very large sword..<br />
&quot;Greets!&quot; she shouted &quot;Gotta dash, only a few minutes till we're sposed to have done something... see you sooon&quot;<br />
and they dissapeared over the horizon.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp001.jpg"><br />
<br />
inside was very tidy and organised, all the other pets were sitting around playing cards or chess.. <br />
Mr Potatohead noticed a table in the centre of the room, on which a single clock sat.. there was a red mark on the clock.. <br />
at 20 minutes past.. hmm.. it was just gone 18 minutes past now.. <br />
he wondered what sort of thing would happen, if any when it was 20 minutes past..<br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp002.jpg"><br />
<br />
there were many desks around, some with paints and glue and paper and some with gold and gems.<br />
Each desk was very tidy and a tool of somekind was placed near or on each one. <br />
even the fireplace had some bits and pieces by it. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp003.jpg"><br />
<br />
suddenly there was a loud ringing, and then a scream of &quot;ITS TIME!!!&quot; all the pets started getting frantic and crazy, <br />
there was fur and fluff and paint flying all over the place<br />
this only lasted about a minute.. <br />
and then the ringing stopped and all the pets set down their tools <br />
and there was many relieved sighs and groans from all around the room. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp004.jpg"><br />
<br />
at the same moment the door oopened and in strolled the hunting party, looking smug (as usual) <br />
&quot;oh yeah!&quot; announced Marishi-Ten &quot; That Kundrav was crying like a baby, HA!&quot;<br />
Coyolxauhqui high fived Marishi-Ten, the other pets were all saying what they did. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp005.jpg"><br />
<br />
&quot;where are all the sculpting knives?&quot; one pet said<br />
&quot;uhh in the box of supplies&quot; said another<br />
&quot;arg, I swear I looked there, but there weren't any. Damn, I couldn't add anything to that sculpture, damn&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;hey hey!&quot; Ix Chel said as she was running over <br />
&quot; you know what i did, huh? huh?! do ya?! well you know i was looking around the house and thought to myself<br />
'you know what Ix, you know what this house needs, <br />
a water cooler, yeah! everyone likes cool water, <br />
EVERYONE!' so look guys I made one, isnt it great, oh yeah!<br />
I made, just now, all by myself, I did!&quot; she finally stopped for air. <br />
Ix chel stood the shaking slighty, and rubbing her paws together. <br />
The other pets were silently looking at her. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp006.jpg"><br />
<br />
&quot;aaaanyway&quot; said Hunahpu, &quot;What are we supposed to do with him then?&quot; <br />
everyone looked at the potato.. <br />
Mr potatohead stood still, with that somewhat creepy fixed grin spread across his face. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp007.jpg"><br />
<br />
*tumblweeds rolled past*<br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/1Mrp008.jpg"><br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take him!&quot; shouted Ix Chel &quot;he can come with me and and and i can show him my inventions, yes i can, lets go infact!&quot;<br />
she grabbed the potato's arm and dragged him off. <br />
<br />
&quot;good luck&quot; whispered Kalfu, &quot;she's nuts&quot;<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
&quot;..And here's another water cooler, you know everyone needs cool water, yes they do especially after a long hard day, you know, yes?! what? you want some cool water?&quot;<br />
she threw a cup of cool water at him.. he grinned.. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp009.jpg"><br />
<br />
&quot;wow, you know what me and you can be best friends, yes yes! and i can make you some nice things, hey! does your house have a water cooler?!..&quot;<br />
<br />
--------<br />
*SEVERAL HOURS LATER*<br />
--------<br />
<br />
&quot;.. you know what else i love?! WATER COOLERS!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp010.jpg"><br />
<br />
Mr Potato heard that alarm ringing again.. <br />
<br />
&quot;..you see the best thing about water.. zzzzzzzzz&quot;<br />
<br />
silence<br />
<br />
Bendis came into the room, &quot;Finally&quot; he said leading the potato out of the room, <br />
&quot;she means well, but jeez, she needs to lay off the skate - thats why she drinks so much.. look we better get you out of here while she's sleeping&quot; <br />
the other pets said goodbye and sent Mr Potato on his way with some other goodies as a memento of his visit<br />
<br />
<img src="http://files.myopera.com/Moon_Cat/albums/521614/Mrp011.jpg"><br />
<br />
&quot;wow, he's really creepy&quot; Chandra remarked<br />
&quot;its that grin&quot; agreed Metztli<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Sirkate</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead arrived at our house around 5pm this evening, looking very well hydrated (and consequently not hung-over) and carrying a small, white packet (which he hastily hid). He was greeted warmly by the ladies of the household, headed by Morgan.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long for Mr. Potatohead to notice the odd dress code that seemed to be in place. Everyone-- male and female-- was wearing a pink feather boa! Everyone except Genevieve, that is. The potato sidled over to her and asked for an explanation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, sounding both disdainful and wistful, &quot;it's because of SirKate. She'd oddly obsessed with breeding. She's got everybody in a boa. In between the hourly actions, they're always... well, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Potatohead looked pointedly at Genevieve's Jester Cap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Oh, I'm not into that. I'm, um. Not athletic enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead gave her a rather lascivious once over, causing Genevieve to blush. Before anything more could happen, however, the hour rolled around and everyone was called to action! Genevieve, unfortunately, had to lead the gathering party, and so abandoned the potato.<br />
<br />
He scampered quickly out of Tiac's way as he flew past on his way to constructing a lovely-- though small-- addition. Then the potato paused for a bit with the crafters. Cyra, Tacc and Mold required his help in sizing their projects (oddly, all jewelry pieces). Luckily, Morgan and Tocu has just woken, and could direct him away from Eris's forge.<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead was safely deposited in the Library (along with the water coolers he'd brought). &quot;Did you want to join us?&quot; Morgan asked, as she led Tocu toward the Futon in the Living Room to make use of their feather boas.<br />
<br />
Frightened, Mr. Potatohead rushed away, ending up in the Tower, where he found Talan, the decrepit, color-blind flying monkey, trying his best to look innocent. He presented the monkey with Raw Milk, and watched as the odd creature flew off and returned with a Paper Airplane he found in a fountain. Bored with paper airplanes (they really only have one good flight before the tip gets bent), he wandered into the Shrine and cast the Dancing Light spell that had been charging.<br />
<br />
In a rush, the hourly activity ended. Genevieve's party (including Tau and Jehanne) returned successful, clutching Mint Leaves, Peanuts, Sugar Beet, and Celery. Unfortunately, Percy, Tede Fa and Abrahil's party returned empty-handed.<br />
<br />
On their heels came SirKate, who happily distributed sled rides to all save Tacc and Jehanne. Just as she was preparing to put them to bed, Mr. Potatohead dropped the small, white package he'd arrived clutching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, is that Skate?&quot; SirKate asked. &quot;Great! Mind if I give it two these two?&quot; Without waiting for a reply, she snatched the packet and offered it to Tacc and Jehanne, along with a drink of cool water (everyone likes cool water!) from the water coolers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what to do with you,&quot; SirKate murmurs, looking at Mr. Potatohead. &quot;I know! I'll send you to visit Housatonic! Don't worry, I'll pay you back for the Skate.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Housatonic</span>:<br />
&quot;When me and my pets returned from our vacation, we found the little guy in a tent on our front lawn.<br />
Poor thing had been out there for days, and only had a single bottle of rum left.<br />
Great was his disappointment when he found out there is no alcohol to be found anywhere in the house.<br />
However, after a generous bribe of treasures he had gathered along his journey, we were on our way to pick up some beverages for our thirsty guest.<br />
<br />
As the hours went by, evening fell and we all started to loosen up. <br />
After some games, we decided to have a dress up party.<br />
Dressed up like a vampire, I watched my pets parade around the room dressed up as ghosts, and all sorts of other more creative creatures.<br />
Until I suddenly saw this shape hiding in the shadows.<br />
I walked up to it, only to find Mr. Potatohead sobbing in a corner.<br />
In his hands he had a pair of talons, all that was left of his fangs.<br />
After a couple of jokes, aided by a glass of wine, I managed to cheer him up.<br />
As we returned to the rest of the gang, a couple of pets walked up to him, threw a piece of white cloth over him, and accepted him into their clan of ghosts.<br />
<br />
This party couldn't last forever, and one by one my pets started to yawn, and soon enough I sent them all to bed.<br />
As I tucked them in, I quietly put a new pair of fangs next to Mr. Potatohead, the replace the ones he broke earlier.<br />
<br />
The next morning, I woke up to the sound of great panic coming from my pets bedroom.<br />
Nobody could find Mr. Potatohead.<br />
His bed was empty, but on his pillow was a little note:<br />
&quot;I had a great time here, but I must be moving on. There is so much of Psypettia I still have to discover.&quot;<br />
We can only hope to hear from him again, wherever he may go next.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Elwingelfje</span>:<br />
&quot;This morning, Mr Potatohead showed up at my doorstep. He was carrying a large bag with his fangs, talons and his Ghost in a Blanket costume.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately he arrived at the wrong place at the wrong time. You see, I just brought three zombies in my house (I heard they're all the rage and as I'm a hype-prone person....). As it turned out, those zombies are not only ugly and smelly, they also have extremely bad manners. As soon as they spotted my smokehouse they went in and without any warning began to fight for the drying pieces of steak. All of my strong pets were asleep at the time, so I went in myself to see them out. When they all started growling and throwing things at me I thought better of it. To be completely honest, I kind of panicked and ran out my front door, looking for someone who might be able to help me.<br />
<br />
This was the moment Mr Potatohead arrived. He immediately spotted my distress and asked why. I quickly explained the matter. Mastermind Potatohead had devised a devilishy clever plan to help me within seconds. Behind my apiary he changed into his ghost costume while I took my ladder.<br />
<br />
We went to the smokehouse together and I put the ladder behind one of the higher windows. It almost slipped and I feared the zombies would hear us, but they were too busy munching to pay any attention. Mr Potatohead bravely climbed up the ladder and shattered the glass with one of his talons. At the same time I was standing behind one of the other windows - I didn't want to miss a second of this spectacle!<br />
<br />
Then Mr Potatohead spoke, in a very deep, low voice.<br />
&quot;My dear fellow dead beings. I am here on behalf of Rizi Vizi Kaera the Devourer, Patron and Guide for the Dead, and I will have to reprimand you severely. We, the dead, are finally gaining some acceptance among the living, and this is a very good thing. And you go out of your way to undo everything good that has been wrought. Let go of that meat. Meat you can also find in the cemetary. Leave the smokehouse and offer the mistress of the house some help with her household chores. If I ever catch you doing anything like this again Rizi Vizi will drag you back to your graves personally - and he is known for dragging slowly and painfully.&quot;<br />
<br />
The zombies were so impressed by his speech that they scurried back to the house as quickly as they could. I was able to get back just in time. They have been very docile and helpful since.<br />
<br />
Of course, Mr Potatohead stayed the rest of the day. He mainly spent time in the sun, with a personal zombie to bring him a wodka lime every other hour. At sundown I replaced his fangs, and rubbed his crusty skin with some shortening. I actually expected him to stay a few more days and enjoy the beauty of my estate. But it could not be so. An hour after sundown I found this note on his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Elwing,<br />
<br />
It was a pleasure to be a guest at your home.<br />
Unfortunately I have been called. I need to leave at once. Remove all traces of my presence and tell your pets and zombies to keep their mouths shut about me.<br />
<br />
I have some very serious business to talk through with someone I will call U_L for reasons of safety. I wish you lots of luck and remind those zombies of me should they be nasty still.<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely, Mastermind Potatohead.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Candy Hearts</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead arrived just as I'd finished baking mother's-day-muffins for my mom. He seemed quite frazzled, and told me in an urgent whisper that no one must know he was there. I snuck him straight into the one room my pets aren't allowed, unfortunately it was the booze room. . Luckily it was time for my pets to do their thing, and Shaun, without knowing the reason, built a lovely little addition for me to fill with plushies and pillows for Mr. Potatohead. When the pets had settled down and were ready for their naps, I smoothly transitioned Mr. Potatohead and his load into the newly soundproofed room. By this time, however, he'd had a few too many mint caprioskas and had started bawling because he'd seen the potatoes I was preparing for the brewery. I calmed him down and he hiccupped his way through the news he needed to deliver. That conversation, however, is top-secret. He isn't hiding his traces, anymore, since he and I took care of his little problem, which is why I'm free to tell this story now. (Though, it might have something to do with a mishap last fall. Mr. Potatohead was visiting my boss in Cuba when he decided to go for a vacation in Australia. Little did he know that those dodgy characters in the airport were being so friendly just to put some E in his magic Mary-Poppins-like back...We had to go see my boss to clear things up. She sincerely apologizes for not seeing him to the airport herself, but there was an issue with the school closing down and our organization needed to raise more money for it. The mishap has been taken care of, and Mr. Potatohead has been cleared of all charges...no wonder the poor thing's had such a drinking problem!)<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead, having sobered up from earlier, decided to help me out with the little ones, playing dress-up, doing a magic show, and going skating with them. I was impressed at how well he handled the little ones, to say the least, and decided that he should be rewarded! So I handed him a desikh plushy, a feathered helmet, 5 each of redsberry wine, blueberry wine and rum, as well as a pet rock amulet. (He seemed to have forgotten all about the poor potatoes in the booze room at this point.) I was amazed when he shoved it all into his Mary-Poppins-like back and tipped his hat to me. <br />
<br />
He was whistling a tune as he headed in the direction of Moonlight Sonata's house, seemingly lighter in spirit, though heavier in baggage. I hope he reaches his destination safely!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Moonlight Sonata</span>:<br />
&quot;When Mr. Potato arrived at my house, he seemed like he was in a sour mood. He also smelled a bit sour. I expected a hang-over. Trying to cheer him up, I offered lots of water and tried to introduce him to my other pets on psy. But he was unimpressed. &quot;Do you know how many pets just like these I have met in my travels?&quot; He asked, with a worldly tone.<br />
<br />
Trying not to be discouraged, I became determined to show Mr. Potato something new. So I set out for the magic portal that connects Psypets and Fifth Age. I called in my mechanics-savvy uncle and had him make a couple tweaks... After the tweaking was finished, I grabbed Mr. Potato&Atilde;ƒ&Acirc;&cent;&Atilde;&macr;&Acirc;&iquest;&Acirc;&frac12;&Atilde;&macr;&Acirc;&iquest;&Acirc;&frac12;s small plastic hand and took a deep breath. Who knew whether the portal would whisk us off to our desired destination... or someplace entirely unknown? I readied my nerves and made the leap, dragging Mr. Potato behind me.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the trip went as planned... and Mr. Potato and I arrived in the realm of Real Life! I promised myself that I would call my uncle more often after this, and whisked Mr. Potato of to the cozy apartment I call home. Surely he would have to be impressed with an entirely new realm to explore?<br />
<br />
Alas, he was not.&quot;This city is dirty!&quot;He complained, &quot;The cars outside are too loud!&quot; And worst of all... &quot;That big black cat just tried to EAT me!&quot; After disciplining Mango (the big black cat), I set my mind to form a new plan. I know! I thought, I'll bring him to the aquarium where I work! Certain that I had come up with a fool-proof plan to show Mr. Potato things that he had never seen before, we got on the local light rail and headed out to Underwater Adventures Aquarium. <br />
<br />
I was unable to convince the front-of-gate employee that Mr. Potato is my relative, so I was forced to pay his admission... but at least I got the kids' price! I was also permitted to take Mr. Potato behind the scenes, where surely he would be fascinated by the sharks, rays, sawfish, and other unique marine life. Things didn't start so well. The kitchen smelled too much like fish, and the lab was too boring. Finally, when I took Mr. Potato up on deck to see the animals, he began to seem interested. He told me that he liked the guinea fowl puffer fish, in particular, and I was pleased. I had high hopes as I took him over to the largest tank, shark cove. <br />
<br />
Blake, a co-worker, was just getting ready to feed the rays. &quot;Want to help?&quot; He asked... but Mr. Potato's arms were too short! I felt bad, but I though Mr. Potato may enjoy watching anyway. I forgot to tell him that it could get a little wet, and an excited southern sting ray flapped his big wings and splashed Mr. Potato! Mr. Potato became startled, and ran off!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; I told Blake, and ran off, trying to find Mr. Potato. Unfortunately, there were a lot of places for him to run off to. I checked all over... And couldn't find Mr. Potato! Discouraged, I stopped and tried to think of where he might have run off to. Clearly he was lost, or he probably would have returned already...<br />

As I thought, Kim was giving a behind-the-scenes tour in the lab next door. &quot;This is our octopus feeding log&quot; I heard her say, &quot;octopi are estimated to be about as smart as a three-to-five year old human child... right now we're even teaching ours to disassemble and reassemble a Mr. Potato Head!&quot; Suddenly it hit me. What if...? Oh no! I checked the schedule, and asked Jane if she had seen Christophe. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think he's gone to feed the octopus,&quot; Jane replied.<br />
<br />
Hoping that I was being paranoid, I ran towards the octopus tank. Mr. Potato had been missing for an awfully long time...<br />
<br />
To my horror, my suspicions were correct. Christophe had already dropped Mr. Potato... my Mr. Potato... into the tank, and the octopus-in-training appeared to be attempting to eat his right eye. The training session wasn't a total failure, however, because she had done some reassembling... unfortunately, none of it was done correctly. &quot;Christophe!&quot; I said, &quot;that's my guest!&quot; And he quickly rescued Mr. Potato.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Mr. Potato's trip was ruined. &quot;I want to go home!&quot; Cried his mouth from the place where his left leg should have been. Defeated, I reassembled him correctly and brought him back through the portal... ready to ship him off in hopes of a better trip.&quot;<br />
<br />

&quot;After Mr. Potatohead's wild adventure at Moonlight Sonata's house he some how stumbled across my house again. <br />
<br />
2 am in the morning he found himself pass out in front of my basement door to be awoken by some chatter. He tries to quietly tip toe to the window and peeks in only to find a band of mad kitties hold pitchforks, scythes and torches.<br />
<br />
Princess Doka King began to speak &quot;the mistress is sleeping and we have to take care of this problem before she awakes.....wait did you hear something outside? Zofija go open the basement door to make sure we have no intruders!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zofija goes opens the door and takes a peek outside (Mr. Potatohead quickly stashes to the bushes to the side), &quot;Princess you are hearing things because there are no zombies outside, wait why is there a fishbowl outside the door???&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead jumps out of the bushes and yells zombies!!!!!! Zofija yelps aloud and Mr. Potatohead is clung to her leg. &quot;Get this thing off me, what the heck is it???&quot; replies Zofija<br />
<br />
Leon comes running over and starts beating the thing with a stick. &quot;Ouch, ouch, ouch&quot; Mr. Potatohead replies and then he lets go. <br />
<br />
Princess Doka King, Fluffy, Aaron, Leon, Zofija and Shii surround Mr. Potatohead as he is lying on the floor. &quot;Oh I remember you now, you visited us in Feburary, how have you been?&quot; Princess replies. Princess picks up the battered potato and gives him some sake. <br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead downs the drink and replies &quot;It's been a long long long journey. I have been on the road for four months now and I am missing my home, which I vaguely remember these days.&quot; He takes a pause &quot;wait what are you guys up to and whats with the zombies???&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess replies &quot;We have some witch craft going on lately through out the town and our homes are being invaded by zombies. We were just about to go mob down one at achiral's house, do you want to join in? We have to do it before sunset. Grab a torch if you are in and you can lead the raid if you want&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead grabs the torch and leads a mob of 6 of your pets to achiral's house, and burst through the front door! In the battle that follows, your pets overtake the zombie, destroying it.<br />
<br />
After returning home, the gang drinks up to some blueberry wine, redsberry wine and some sake that the had gathered before comming home. &quot;That was an awesome hunt, let's do it again&quot; Mr. Potatohead replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another time Mr. Potatohead as we are getting the zombie count under control and let's get some sleep before the other pets awake&quot; replies Princess.<br />
<br />
The sunset morning arrives and the rest of the pets awake to find Mr. Potatohead sleeping on the couch. <br />
<br />
Our guest has returned, we should let him sleep and chat with him when he awakes.<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead finally awakes but there is no one home. He starts searching the house looking for some booze and stumbles across a machine. &quot;Oh what does this machine do&quot; <br />
<br />
He pushs the big red button and whoosh he is sucked in.................1 item was teleported successfully!<br />
<br />
Everyone arrives home and find Mr. Potatohead gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a bummer that we didn't get to chat with him more to hear about his journey so far, oh why is the teleporter button blinking&quot; replies Masikaluv. <br />
<br />
Location selected - Australia. &quot;Hmmmm.......I wonder who lives there and oh i wonder what was the fishbowl for??&quot; Masikaluv replies.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Lillie</span>:<br />
&quot;Wow, Look who turned up out of the blue!! Mr PotatoHead, home for a holiday .<br />
Mr Pot Head (as we like to call him) has spent hours with all my pets sitting round him, talking of his adventures and close calls.<br />
He opened his suitcase and out fell a whip, pitchfork, mask, wanted poster, empty wine glasses and a little black book with lots of phone numbers. Oh if any of you ladies is missing underwear.....I'm afraid his suitcase had quite a lot of frillies in it. I'm afraid he has turned into a snowdropper <br />
<br />
The travel bug has really got him as no sooner had I finished doing his laundry  and he was packing his bag to go on further travels. <br />
I am sending him on his way to simpleyetcomplex and hope he behaves himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Simpleyetcomplex</span>:<br />
&quot;*Whisper* Whisper* SSsshhh I heard something. Simplycomplex was telling all of the younger pet to be quiet.<br />
Mr. Potato head was hiding outside near the garbage. Simplycomplex told every one to stay put while she checked around the house.<br />
Simplycomplex checked everywhere with her sword. Then she noticed she was missing 8m! She checked the trash and found Mr. potato head.<br />
Mr. Potato head shrieked as she swung her sword at him and just barely missed him. Mr. potato head started yelling d-d-don't h-h-hurt m-m-me.<br />
Who are you! Why I am Mr. potato head. The she brought him inside breaking the DON'T let any strangers in the house rule. The other pets got to play with Mr. potato head till they all fell asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the morning the pets realized their guest was sleeping so the let him be. Simplycomplex was ready to level up and as Mr. potato head woke up he saw many sparkles around her as she grew into a better defeater. She was sparkling while she transformed into being tougher.<br />
Mr. potato head never had seen that and he said &quot;Oooo Awww&quot;. Simplycomplex shrieked as she finishes leveling up. Oh it was just you. The younger pets have trouble sharing as so don't let them know you are awake.<br />
They heard a shriek as two pets died because they did not like tea and were hungry. Simply complex was sad so as they all went to bury them Mr. potato head stayed behind. <br />
<br />
Finally when they all came home Mr. potato head told them goodnight as they all fell asleep. He then snuck out of the house and got attacked by zombies. Whoosh he fell into a deeeeeep hole. Which brought him to the private trades in a box for Sockpie.<br />
As the pets woke up they wondered where he was. They checked everywhere and in the private trading house. They only saw a receipt that said socks in a pie. They all wondered where he has went and they hoped he would visit again. They almost grabbed their pitchforks to hunt down this socks in a pie but then they got in trouble for letting a stranger into the house.<br />
There goes summer toys! I do wish he would have behaved and stayed longer though&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Sock Pie</span>:<br />
&quot;Day one did not go well...I had been very busy and didn't bother to check incoming. As it happened, I heard some peculiar noises coming from incoming. After searching for two hours in the sea of neglected boxes, I came upon a very angry Mr. Potatohead. He had waved his small white arms wildly and fired a string of curses at me. He accused me of attempting to murder him by starving him in a box.<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead grew agitated that with one violent wave of his arms, his ears snapped off. Mr. Potatohead howled in anger and looked for a scapegoat. Unfortunately, I was the nearest person at the time. &quot;YOU STOLE MY EARS,&quot; he shrieked. &quot;MY BEAUTIFUL PINK EARS, ALL GONE! GIVE 'EM BACK! GIVE 'EM BACK RIGHT NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Screaming had taken a lot of energy out of Mr. Potatohead. He abruptly went silent and collapsed on the floor, snoring.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, his ears had rolled away, down the street. Knowing that many people wanted ears for their own Mr. Potatoheads, I raced after them. Luckily I snatched the ears before they attracted too much attention.<br />
<br />

<br />
When I had returned to my house, I found Mr. Potatohead playing in my greenhouse with Cyra, my mischievous little imp. I called the little potato over and told him to hold still. He didn't, and squirmed quite a bit, but I still managed to pop the ears back in place. After that, I showed him into my trophy room. I expected him to be at least mildly impressed, but he just yawned in a bored sort of way and demanded me for some wine. I went to my storage room and offered him my best homemade redsberry wine. He gulped it down and held out his glass for more. Soon my whole supply of redsberry wine had been depleted. Seeing there was no more, Mr. Potatohead drunkenly settled in my bed for a nap.<br />
<br />
When night had arrived, Mr. Potatohead was still sleeping. Not wanting to squish my guest, I went to find a couch. Unfortunately, my pets had gotten to the couches before me.<br />
<br />
That night I had slept on the floor.<br />
<br />
I awoke to see Mr. Potatohead bashing me over and over again on my arm with a little yellow plastic shovel. I felt very irritated today, partly because of my now nonexistent wine supply, and partly because it was three in the morning. The bruises forming on my arm did not help.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; I groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;There were zombies in your house,&quot; Mr. Potatohead said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead nodded, smiling triumphantly. &quot;I ran over to the plaza and called for help, and lots of pets came, and they got rid of the ugly beasties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! You killed Ziggly and Clara? Wait a second...how did the mob get into the house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well they, um...got a bit...carried away...&quot;<br />
<br />
<img src="http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/944/zombieed0.png"><br />
<br />
Alarmed, I jumped out of my sleeping bag and ran out of the bedroom, heading to the living room. All my pets were huddled together, looking shaken. They all held weapons; sticks, swords, shovels, sculpting knives, etcetera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, WHAT happened?&quot; I demanded, looking at the debris everywhere. The wallpaper had been torn down. Some of the roof had fallen off. Windows were shattered, and the door was gone. And there were pet-shaped holes in the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;We tried to defend our home when the crazy mob attacked,&quot; Exotic explained, &quot;but there were too many. We were outnumbered&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Psypets offered house insurance,&quot; I muttered. I pointed at the troublesome potato and told him to get back to bed.<br />
<br />
I told my pets to help me get the house back together. We worked long and accomplished little. Hours later, Mr. Potatohead emerged from the bedroom and asked for some wine. I rolled my eyes, but not wanting to disappoint a guest, headed to the marketplace. I came back, grocery bags filled with alcoholic beverages.<br />
<br />
The days went on like this: Mr. Potatohead wakes up, asks for wine and other snacks, and waits as I go to the marketplace. I buy food and wine, and come back. He drinks most of the wine, then takes a nap. He wakes up, plays hide-and-go-seek or something with Cyra (they had become close friends), and then drinks the rest of the wine and sleeps until the next morning.<br />
<br />
I watched my savings drop lower and lower. Even Lakisha asked me what I needed all the money for. &quot;You wouldn't believe me,&quot; was what I always replied. Who knew one little potato could devour so much food and drink?<br />
<br />
Finally I decided to do something about my diminishing cash. That morning I went to the market, as usual, but instead of redsberry and blueberry wine, I bought tea. All kinds of tea; sweet tea, berry tea, green tea, ginger tea, and even fire spice tea. I returned to my house (which by the way is looking a lot better now) and, carrying a large box of tea, went to find the hungry potato.<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead was in the kitchen, hunting for leftovers he may have missed. Upon seeing my return, he looked up in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, it isn't wine this time,&quot; I said, ignoring his disappointed look. &quot;I got something new for you. Tea!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead looked curiously at the cups of steaming tea I placed before him. He took a cautious sip. Then he smiled and drained the whole cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is very good,&quot; he declared, dumping sweet berry tea in his mouth. I grinned. Perhaps he had finally gotten over his obsession with wine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know someone who's got more tea,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm? Whmph?&quot; the potato couldn't speak clearly, he was busy drinking a cup of fire spice tea.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Tea Queen!&quot; And with that, I grabbed his tiny arm and placed him, along with the box of tea, into my shiny new teleporter. After typing in Rika's name, I pushed the Make It So button, and sent him to Rika's house.&quot;<br />
<br />

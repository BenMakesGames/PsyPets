Rhyme<br />
It’s a bi-polar moment, a bi-polar time<br />
As you can tell with my rhythm &amp; rhyme<br />
Now I know where inspiration came for Dr. Seuss<br />
It was bi-polar that gave him his juice<br />
<br />
I’ve got no mouse in a house for you<br />
I’m not pulling out a thing one or thing two<br />
What I’ve got rattling around in my brain<br />
Has nothing to do with a plane or a train<br />
<br />
I’ve got cold steel and cuts too deep<br />
Green eggs and ham, those you can keep<br />
Dr. Seuss was bi-polar, but I’m to the extreme<br />
I wonder if Horton could hear my silent scream<br />
<br />
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue<br />
How about blood on the tiles is that good for you<br />
Who-zits and what-its, yeah that’s just fine<br />
But I give you bloody cuts, all in a line<br />
<br />
Dr. Seuss bi-polar? Maybe just a little<br />
But little kids and his hee-hee is all he could dittle<br />
I’m all grown up and to me, bloody is my scene<br />
Because I’m bi-polar, bi-polar to the extreme<br />
<br />
Cat in the hat, I’d like to break his neck<br />
Those two messy twins, I’d only need a sec<br />
Green eggs and ham, I’d shove down your throat<br />
And that cat, yeah, he’d make a nice coat<br />
<br />
Dr. Seuss might have been bi-polar, but he was a wussy<br />
Who gave us childish rhyme cuz he was a sissy<br />
But in my head blood, cuts and bone chilling screams<br />
Manic depression and bi-polar, to the extreme.

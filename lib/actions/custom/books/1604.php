~June <span style="color:green">25th<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">Started out today, looking for my adventure, little did I know what was waiting. I was wearing my trusty tin foil hat, had my  venturing belt around my waist, with a bronze vessel my mama just picked up at the market, duct tape (just cuz you never know when your gonna need some) and a talon I lost some freedom for. Yep. . . it is a huge bruise. <br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">I had decided to follow Siverios Stream, I had just crossed into the Mystorius Woods, when I heard scuffling and grunting in the distance. That didnt bother me, what did bother me was the fact that I wasnt stopping and walking away, I was walking closer. My mama had warned me about the ghosts and gobbalins that resided here, and that was why I had came, but my palms were telling me in their sweaty way that I should turn around and head back.<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">I wasnt listening, I was curious about them, I slid to the ground and wormed my way though the underbrush, sneaky-like. I slid forward till I could smell wood smoke and bar-b-que. . .  Oh my tummy started growling something fierce. Juicy bar-b, I could almost taste it. (*future reference - eat before you start out venturing*) <br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">Peeking through the brush I could see two ghost in sheets sitting around a campfire arguing. <br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">*I told you Herman to bring the water jug.*<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">*You said no such thing, Sashia!* A gruff voice answered back.<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">*I very truly remember telling you to grab the jug.*<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">*I thought you said grab the grub.* Pointing to the fish bar-b-queing on the spit, * I grabbed the grub.*<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">*And when they said ~Get your brains for free~  you thought they said ~Get your brains for a flea~ and stepped outta line.* Shashia answered back, throwing a rock at Hermans head. *Now your gonna have to hike to the stream.*<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">Okay I had a plan. . .  get something for my belly and make nice with the ghosties.<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">I popped up and broke out into the clearing before my mind got the better of me. <br />
 <span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">*Hey. . .  for a little of that great smelling bar-b, I will get you some nice cool water.*<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">The couple jumped up and yelled so loud my ears are still ringing, but they didnt wait for me to try and calm them, they jumped up and ran away.<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">It was too weird, ghosts scared of a little boy. Mama always said that if your scared of something, more than likely it is just as scared of you, sometimes even more so. I guess she was right!<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">I hoped that they would come back but they didnt, so I went down and got some water in my vessel and left it there by the fire, took a piece of the bar-b to eat on my way back home.<br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">Mama was calling for me when I got back to our block, I told her of my adventure, she said that I shouldnt have gone into the woods without letting her know. But that I did a good thing. She wasnt even  mad that I left behind the vessel, but next time I go adventuring she said to just take a jug. <br />
<span style="color:white">___<span style="color:green">I am already planning my next adventure. . . <br />
<br />

The Firedell Chronicles<br />
<br />
By Deliqueena &copy; 2007<br />
<br />
In Firedell the days are filled with<br />
Laughter, dancing<br />
Magic, smoke.<br />
Cinnamon trees grow wild and plenty,<br />
Sweetness reigns and fire burns bright.<br />
In the air are smells of cooking<br />
Flowing, touching<br />
All the land.<br />
In the dell there lives an angel<br />
Free from worry<br />
Free from harm.<br />
But something sinister is lurking<br />
In the shadows near and far.<br />
No harm befalls the noble creature<br />
As she is taken through the night.<br />
Snatched by a presence,<br />
Dark and furry,<br />
In the legends new and old.<br />
No one sees the sleeping beauty<br />
Carried to an unknown land.<br />
Someone wakes and finds her missing,<br />
Sends out people looking far.<br />
Can they find this fallen angel<br />
Without the guidance magic gives?<br />
Their fire burns without waning<br />
As they journey through Darkness Falls.<br />
<br />
 Arella woke to the sounds of laughter, dancing and, strangely, soft giggling. She closed her eyes and tried to fall back asleep, without much success. She sat up, only to find her whole bed covered in gummy worms, and her friends Tishkin and Yuki cracking up in the corner. They had obviously been watching her for a while, as they were now in hysterics. <br />
“Ok, wise guys, whose bright idea was this?” Arella demanded playfully. This simply made them laugh harder. This sent Arella over the edge, and she joined them, rolling around on the floor laughing themselves silly. <br />
10 minutes later, they picked themselves up off the floor and suddenly remembered why they were so exited. Today was the day of the biggest festival in Firedell, which was also the biggest party of the year, and Arella was supposed to be there so that she could help out. <br />
After Arella, Tishkin and Yuki had gotten ready, they went to pick up their friends Elivina and Zandine on the way to the festival.<br />
That night was the best and most memorable night that Arella, Tishkin, Yuki, Elivina and Zandine had ever had. They partied so hard and long that they finally left only after the music stopped.<br />
 As Arella walked home, she caught a glimpse of something dark creeping through the bush.  All she saw was a flash of colour before she was taken. The only trace left of her was her shoes.<br />
In the morning, Tishkin woke up in Arella’s bed. He looked around, only to find Yuki, Elivina and Zandine sprawled on the floor around him. The one person who wasn’t there was Arella, Tishkin realised. <br />
He sat up with a jolt as he realised that she was nowhere to be found.<br />
As the dawn broke, four people set out from the city wearing long coats and carrying nothing but a backpack each.  Tishkin was leading the search party, with Yuki, Elivina and Zandine following. They were a strange bunch. Yuki, with her bizarre sense of humour and fleeting magic, Elivina with her upbeat attitude and watchful eye, Zandine as a protector, a warrior, and Tishkin? He was just Tishkin, quiet, friendly, bookworm Tishkin. Arella was the leader of their little group, but she was also the empress of Firedell, although her friends were more important to her. She was still young, after all, Tishkin thought. How could someone rule an empire when they were still a child themselves? But as he thought this, he remembered why they were here. To save their best friend, their leader and their ruler. And with that, he continued into the rising sun, oblivious to the shadow watching them in the dark. <br />
<br />
Arella woke to the smells of musty books, damp carpet, and chocolate chip cookies. This was beginning to become a ritual, waking to odd sounds and smells. She looked around, and saw only bleak walls covered partly in moss. When she sat up, her head began to click into gear. Where was she and how did she get here? Where was here?  What had happened? With all these questions, Arella did nothing for a while. She just sat on the thin mattress she had been sleeping on, and thought for a while, before she realised how silly this was. She, Arella, empress of Firedell, ruler of the kingdom, was stuck. She got up and walked around the cave, discovering many secret nooks and crannies that she had overlooked before. Then suddenly, she reached out to touch a vase and found herself in quite a different place altogether. This place was bright, and evidently where the cookie aromas had come from. It appeared to be a kitchen, but for whom Arella could not tell. <br />
“Good morning empress. Sleep well?” the voice came from the next room, cheerful with a hint of sarcasm. “Welcome to my humble abode, or as I like to call it, my secret lair.” The voice came closer until Arella could make out the shape of a person. “I am Xylon, Ruler of the underground.” He smiled a little as he said this, as if it were a joke. Arella was still too shocked to speak. <br />
Now his charm was obvious, as well as his well shaped body and good looks, although Arella took an instant dislike to him. Underneath his charms and appeal, she sensed there was something odd about him. For one thing, he lived in a cave. And he had also kidnapped her. <br />
“Why did you bring me here, Xylon? I want the truth. I saw you following me!” Arella barely managed not to scream. “No special reason.” Xylon replied coolly. “Only because you have been the object of my desire for years, yet I have been unable to locate you for months. I love you, Arella! And I will not let you leave my grasp again. Never!” He exclaimed. Arella could see the fury and passion in his eyes. “My friends are looking for me, and-” Arella began, but was cut off by his triumphant laugh. “No one will ever find the entrance to this place.  They have tried! Oh, how they have tried!  But this cave is the only place where I have found solitude.” With that, he got up and left, leaving Arella to sort out the puzzle her life had become.<br />
<br />
Tishkin was tired. The group had been searching from dawn to dusk without any trace of Arella. Suddenly, Yuki flew past him excitedly. They all rushed to see what she had found, as she had the best eyesight of the group. As they drew closer, they noticed how small and insignificant it looked. It was a shoe, meaningless to most people, but they all knew. This was one of Arella’s favourite pairs of shoes, the ones she wore to every occasion possible. Magic shoes, enchanted to last a lifetime. And they all now knew that something terrible had befallen Arella.<br />
As she sat on her makeshift mattress, Arella had dark thoughts running through her brain. They won’t find me, not for ages. I’ll be here forever, and I miss them, especially Tishkin. I want to go home. I miss my home, my clothes, my shoes, Tishkin….. I miss Tishkin. I miss Yuki’s laughter, Zandine’s optimism, Elivina’s readiness to help, and Tishkin’ knowledge, and his smile, and I might never see them again. I want to go home…….. I might never see that again either. With that thought, she stopped, and thought over what that could mean. No more parties, festivals or laughter with friends. No more chocolate, coke or Tishkin. Oh how she missed him. She formed a picture in her head, of her and Tishkin at the festival, that fateful night when all this pain began. Was it really only a few days ago? It felt like weeks, months, or even years, but without Tishkin it seemed like the end of the world.<br />
Tishkin was having similar thoughts. That night, he sat by the campfire, turning Arella’s shoe over and over in his hands. Arella, I hope you’re ok, what would I do without you? He dozed off, still thinking about Arella, as the small group packed up and moved on.<br />

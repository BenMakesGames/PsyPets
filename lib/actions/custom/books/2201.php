Deosil go by the waxing moon, chanting out the joyful tune.<br />
Widdershins go when the moon doth wane,<br />
and the werewolf howls by the dread wolfsbane. <br />
<br />
When the Lady's moon is new, kiss the hand to Her times two.<br />
When the moon rides at Her peak then your heart's desire seek. <br />
<br />
Heed the North winds mighty gale, lock the door and trim the sail.<br />
When the Wind blows from the East, expect the new and set the feast. <br />

When the wind whispers from the West, all hearts will find peace and rest. <br />

Four times the Major Sabbats mark in the light and in the dark. <br />
<br />
As the old year starts to wane the new begins, it's now Samhain.<br />
When the time for Imbolc shows watch for flowers through the snows. <br />
<br />
When the wheel begins to turn soon the Beltane fires will burn.<br />
As the wheel turns to Lamas night power is brought to magick rite. <br />
<br />
Four times the Minor Sabbats fall use the Sun to mark them all.<br />
When the wheel has turned to Yule light the log the Horned One rules. <br />
<br />
In the spring, when night equals day time for Ostara to come our way.<br />
When the Sun has reached it's height time for Oak and Holly to fight. <br />
<br />
Harvesting comes to one and all when the Autumn Equinox does fall.<br />
Heed the flower, bush, and tree by the Lady blessed you'll be. <br />
<br />
Where the rippling waters go cast a stone, the truth you'll know.<br />
When you have and hold a need, harken not to others greed. <br />
<br />

Merry Meet and Merry Part bright the cheeks and warm the heart. <br />
<br />
Mind the Three-fold Laws you should three times bad and three times good.<br />
When misfortune is enow wear the star upon your brow. <br />
<br />
Be true in love this you must do unless your love is false to you. <br />

These Eight words the Rede fulfill: <br />
<br />
&quot;An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye Will&quot;

Despite the resident name, i'm actually called Faye. You can call me either, though, i'm not at all bothered. i'd like to refer you to the 2007 Who's Who for a better description, because to be honest, i haven't changed all that much since then, and i have nothing very interesting to say about myself. Oh! i collect Disco Balls, though, if you ever wanted to get rid of some.<br />

I am the meanest person you will ever meet <img src="gfx/emote/wink.gif" alt="[wink]" border=0 />; I pride myself in thinking that I'm an intelligent and kind person. My biggest goal on psy is to collect every profile item on the site (Aries shares this goal). I'm a very laid back person and it should be noted if you ever need anything, feel free to ask.<br />

I am a momma to two boys age 4 &amp; 5 that I homeschool. They help me name my pets, and love me to tell them about the pets. I have two cats and a dog, but am allergic to them all. Chronic illnesses and injuries plague me, and I get angry easy. But I also forgive easy. This is the only online game I play right now, and my main goal in the game is to have one of each profile item. Hobbies are: reading, writing, online stuff and art. I like  collecting stamps, unusual boxes and tea items. Most often you can find me playing with my kids and spending time with my husband (an airplane enthusiast). The place I feel most at home in the world is the beach.<br />

Blackmail hasn't changed much from last year - she is still a strange and obsessive girl, though less active on the Psypets forums. She loves money, both spending and keeping them, and is therefore currently looking for a job. She hopes that by the end of next year she will have earned enough money for a plane ticket to Japan, so she can study Japanese there. Blackmail has also become extra sappy lately, due to excessive listening to cheesy love songs. She is very embarrassed about this fact but still unable to quit this nasty habit of hers.<br />

Blackstar collects Shimoku Plushies. Give her gossamer and she will love you. She's also an artist, writes random drabble, and can fly and probably has fleas. She demands your love, steals souls on occasion, and gives friendly advice. Blackstar lives on a farm, has a couple lovely horses, and raises chickens. Hatches them too. She loves her kitty, he is utterly awesome and demands your love as well. She also loves Stargate and House. But mostly, she loves Psypets, and is far to addicted to leave.<br />

Celeste3 originally signed up on February the 17th in 2007, but since then has restarted her account several times for various pathetic reasons. She enjoys making large batches of limeade for her pets, which is in part due to her <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">obsession</span> appreciation of limes, and partly the cause of the appreciation in the first place (I mean, the green is just so pretty). She often lurks on the plaza, posts fairly often (though not so much as she used to), and is eternally jealous of all the artists there.<br />
She doesn't have any particular collections, but is a packrat in general - and tends to hold onto useless things such as sculpting knives and small giamonds. She does however try to keep her profile in meticulous order, and has profile items not according to rarity, but to how pretty she thinks their graphics are.<br />
She also has a tendency to ramble on. (And on and on and on...)<br />

Censored in real life is a lot like Censored on psypets. She doesn't say much and isn't very interesting. She spends her time knitting, reading, collecting typewriters,pampering her cats and finding creative ways to skip gym class. Censored thinks it's so cool you got to know all about her.<br />

A fairly quiet one, who occasionally attempts to be an online entrepreneur and get a monopoly on crafting materials in the Flea Market when the fancy strikes her.<br />
She also fancies herself as a bit of an artist and will eventually have custom graphics on her pets. Eventually.<br />
She currently has approximately 7,000moneys, and so far collects nothing in particular.<br />

Grace C (mostly known as just Grace) isn't around on Psy much anymore, but she is too attached to it (and has spent too much time on it!) to leave. Mainly, she lurks on the forums and sits around collecting Bunny Ears. Outside of Psy, Grace plays the violin and reads too much for her own good. She never tires of recommending her favorite authors, who include Alison Croggon, Steven Erikson, and Jacqueline Carey, to anyone who will listen.<br />

kazo is also known as the snow fairy of Psypets. She is relatively unknown here, for she's a bit intimidated by the general public, but a rare few gets to see her lingering but faint presence fluttering around here. Once in a blue moon kazo comes out from her hiding in her snow castle to gives out 'the fairies blessings' to the wonderful people and their pets here, such as the popular event 'daily giveaways'. kazo is very obsessive compulsive, she likes hording treasures of pretties and shinnies, but all the treasures in the world can not measure up to her beloved pets.<br />

I have a few hobbies on PsyPets. One of the more interesting ones is collecting jerkies for the moat. I have a love - hate relationship with the moat's pirates. The majority of the time, they crave easy to find/cheap items. However, they have been known to create major hassles. With 61 Piece of Eight's, they have demanded bronze mail, red in-line skates, and most recently, a bronze shovel. All of which have required me to spend a few thousand to simply be thrown the to the pirates. I hope one of these days there will be an option to fight the dreaded pirates. Or maybe one to forfeit the cheap gold coin. However with Ben, we may never see that come into play.<br />

I am a rodent of undiscernable size who enjoys fine literature and sparkly things. I am currently collecting experience through my pets. Vicariously. So that they will grow up and not be failures, and then I will have more moneys to have more pets. Technically I'm an oldbie, so there. Also, I enjoy having pet newbies.<br />

Kriet's an oldbie who doesn't feel like an oldbie. He's got tons of stuff, and collects random junk like a madman, but still doesn't seem to be as successful as the other oldbies. Yet, he doesn't care. He's been on Psypets for more than 3 years, and his longest break was maybe 2 months. Kriet loves to write, draw, and RP, and you'll rarely see him post outside of the RP boards (unless they're largely dead, or he's buying junk in commerce). He's a crazy college student, just starting out with his own life. Though he usually keeps to himself, he enjoys a good party every now and again, and (as white as he is) he loves to dance. If you get the chance to visit him (hint, hint) he'll do his best to keep you entertained. A computer science major who's also a gamer, who's also a dancer, who's also a martial artist, who's also a writer, who also used to act, Kriet's a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Or, you know, just a regular guy trying to keep his life under control while still attempting to enjoy himself.<br />

Possibly the most hated person among the popular crowd of Psypets, yet generally deemed &quot;nice&quot; by everyone else, lamoxlamae is an eccentric computer programmer with way too much time on her hands. Between doing copious distracting research and helping out people, she also likes to hold random contests in the park and chatting with friends. Her favorite non-psypets games are Puzzle Pirates and Blood (an old shooter by Monolith). Her favorite pets are Darwin the Mad Scientist... I mean, evolved goldfish and Malka the Malkavian... I mean, hunter. Feel free to mail her, she generally likes making new friends and doesn't bite... hard... or in an unpleasant fashion.<br />

Rainribbon is a literature-lover whose hobbies include writing, creating artwork, collecting assorted objects, and playing various and sundry internet games. Like her owner, Ramoth the dragon is at least moderately nerdy and enjoys inventing items from all-too-expensive materials. Meanwhile, Darrgon defends their estate from the attacks of assorted monsters, hunts, and drags home shiny things to please Ramoth, his mate. Ramoth and Darrgon have five offspring: Corn&Atilde;ƒ&Acirc;&copy;lienne, Ferkoth, Draven, Komeryu, and a baby that has been dubbed &quot;The Spawn&quot;.<br />

Stalks the Plaza 80% of her online time, but doesn't often post. Likes to be self sufficient (recycling everything that can be recycled, has more defeaters than any other pet, etc). Offline, she plays, listens to and studies music.<br />

I have a fetish for Tea Leaves and everything else Tea! I've been around to watch Psy grow, and my is it ever changing and building. Psypettian forever [love] My pets mean the world to me, and I love to spoil them with all their favorite foods. Personally, I am 20 years old and have a gorgeous baby boy named Draike. I love animals, have an addiction to music and the internet. Alice in Wonderland is my favorite story of all time, and I love writing poetry and reading. <br />

My favorite thing about PsyPets is the pets themselves. I keep vowing to never have too many to remember them all, but the Pet Shelter is SO addictive!<br />

I like odd Characters, as you can see by how I named my pets. (Shadow is the best pet name in the world.)<br />

I don't collect anything in particular, but I spent all my money getting new badges, new graphics, and new pets. After a brief-ish hiatus, I'm back to spending way too much time on Psy.<br />

Yikatta enjoys drawing and playing psypets more than anything. To let you in on a little secret, Yikatta has acctually been on psypet when there was such a thing a &quot;the grocery store&quot;. She's been wandering Psypets for over 4 years, thing is, during those 4 years she was busy deleting and re-creating new accounts. She is still unsure why she had done so. But now, she has found her place. The easiest way to please her, send her some pearls, she'd love that! So GIVE THEM TO HER NOW! She also claims the Scorpion as her animal incarnation. Only SHE can be the scorpion. Yikatta own the sacred Blood Pearl, the Scroll of Summoning Scorpion and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29%23Sasori">Sasori</a>

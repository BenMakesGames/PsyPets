<p>HERG RESEARCH LABS - Fear swept the otherwise-peaceful scientific community of PsyPettia, as it has been named by its inhabitants, yesterday when an estimated 666 otherworldly Demons appeared, causing trouble for the inhabitants and their pets.</p>
<p>"We found what we thought was graffiti on the City Hall that morning," recalls HERG Director Eve Heidel, "It looked like a bunch of the apocalyptic nonsense you'd expect, given the date 6/6/06.  We tried to clean it off, of course, but it wouldn't come up.  That's when we started to get a little nervous.  It's still there now."</p>
<p>"With help from community members such as blumaroo and Kika, we were able to translate Rizi Vizi's message entirely, but not before it was too late."  Julio Beiler is one of HERG's newest members, an archaeologist and currently the only Ancient Script expert on Earth.  "It was a pretty interesting message, even when we thought it was a prank: 'Father, you age!  Soon your precious daughter will be weak.  What then, when there is nothing left that can avert my will?  Nor shall you forget this day, Children of Ki Ri.'  Of course, once the Demons showed up, we all realized how real it was."</p>
<p>According to Ancient legend, Ki Ri is the God that is itself creation, and the father of the three Gods Rizi Vizi, Kaera and Gizubi.  Rizi Vizi represents the chaotic end of all things, and is constantly at odds with Kaera, who represents order and perfection.</p>
<p>"If you want to believe the message," Julio added," and it's pretty hard not to at this point, Rizi Vizi is growing in power."</p>
<p>Demons still plague people's homes, but fortunately there is a solution.  Several community members' pets are capable of defeating evil creatures that spring up, and some of these creatures possess a "Seal of Solomon."</p>
<p>"Solomon the Wise was known, among other things, for dealing with spirits, particularly in containing them in bronze lamps," Julio explained.  "The language on this Seal is unmistakably Ancient, but the effects are the same: read one of these Seals loudly and clearly," he snaps a finger, "and no more Demons."</p>
<p>"Again, we have the community to thank," said Eve.  "Many PsyPet owners collect [the Seals] daily.  We had hundreds in our Storage rooms until yesterday, when people started giving them out to new members that would have otherwise had no way to deal with the problem.  I know our primary purpose here is to study Hollow Earth, but it's great to see that we're also able to maintain a thriving and friendly community."</p>

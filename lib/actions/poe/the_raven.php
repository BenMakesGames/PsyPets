<font class="size16"><b>THE RAVEN</b></font><br>
<br>
<font class="size14"><b>by Edgar Allan Poe</b><br>
(1845)</font><br>
<br>
<font class="size13">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
" 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door;<br>
Only this, and nothing more."<br>
<br>
Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,.<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,<br>
Nameless here forevermore.<br>
<br>
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
Thrilled me---filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>
" 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,<br>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.<br>
This it is, and nothing more."<br>
<br>
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
"Sir," said I, "or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
That I scarce was sure I heard you." Here I opened wide the door;---<br>
Darkness there, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing<br>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br>
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,<br>
Lenore?, This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word,<br>
"Lenore!" Merely this, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before,<br>
"Surely," said I, "surely, that is something at my window lattice.<br>
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore.<br>
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.<br>
" 'Tis the wind, and nothing more."<br>
<br>
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore.<br>
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door.<br>
Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,<br>
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>
Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore.<br>
Tell me what the lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore."<br>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br>
<br>
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;<br>
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,<br>
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
With such name as "Nevermore."<br>
<br>
But the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only<br>
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered;<br>
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before;<br>
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br>
Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br>
<br>
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster<br>
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore,---<br>
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
Of "Never---nevermore."<br>
<br>
But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore --<br>
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br>
<br>
Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er<br>
She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br><br>
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath<br>
Sent thee respite---respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br>
Quaff, O quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"<br>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore!"<br>
<br>
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--<br>
On this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore:<br>
Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me I implore!"<br>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br>
<br>
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--<br>
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore---<br>
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?<br>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br>
<br>
"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--<br>
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door!<br>
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br>
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br>
<br>
And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming.<br>
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
Shall be lifted---nevermore!<br></font>

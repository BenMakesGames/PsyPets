I held my breath as she drew near, part in respect for her beauty, and part in fear for what the minthe oil of that cloak would do to a person who drew them in too hastily.</p>
<p><em>And then, later in the book:</em></p>
<p>"Gossamer!" I told them, though surely they now thought it was more the drink talking, and less myself, "And mint leaves plated on top of it!"  But they only laughed more.</p>

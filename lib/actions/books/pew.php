<p><i>by Robert Louis Stevenson</i></p>
<p>
YOU looked so tempting in the pew,<br />
You looked so sly and calm -<br />
My trembling fingers played with yours<br />
As both looked out the Psalm.<br />
<br />
Your heart beat hard against my arm,<br />
My foot to yours was set,<br />
Your loosened ringlet burned my cheek<br />
Whenever they two met.<br />
<br />
O little, little we hearkened, dear,<br />
And little, little cared,<br />
Although the parson sermonised,<br />
The congregation stared.

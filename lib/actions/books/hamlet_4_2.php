SCENE II. Another room in the castle.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter HAMLET</i><br>
HAMLET <br>
Safely stowed.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN: <br>
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?<br>
O, here they come.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</i><br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence<br>
And bear it to the chapel.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Do not believe it.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Believe what?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.<br>
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what<br>
replication should be made by the son of a king?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his<br>
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the<br>
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like<br>
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to<br>
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have<br>
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you<br>
shall be dry again.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
I understand you not, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a<br>
foolish ear.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go<br>
with us to the king.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
The body is with the king, but the king is not with<br>
the body. The king is a thing--<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
A thing, my lord!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt</i>

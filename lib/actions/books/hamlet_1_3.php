SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA</i> <br>
LAERTES <br>
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:<br>
And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br>
But let me hear from you.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
Do you doubt that?<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br>
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br>
A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
No more but so?<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Think it no more;<br>
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br>
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br>
The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br>
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br>
For he himself is subject to his birth:<br>
He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br>
The safety and health of this whole state;<br>
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br>
Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
As he in his particular act and place<br>
May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br>
If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br>
To his unmaster'd importunity.<br>
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br>
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br>
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:<br>
The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br>
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br>
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>
Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br>
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br>
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br>
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,<br>
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>
And recks not his own rede.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
O, fear me not.<br>
I stay too long: but here my father comes.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter POLONIUS</i><br>
<br>
A double blessing is a double grace,<br>
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!<br>
And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware<br>
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br>
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>


Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well<br>
What I have said to you.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
'Tis in my memory lock'd,<br>
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Farewell.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Marry, well bethought:<br>
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late<br>
Given private time to you; and you yourself<br>
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:<br>
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,<br>
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,<br>
You do not understand yourself so clearly<br>
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br>
What is between you? give me up the truth.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br>
Of his affection to me.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,<br>
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br>
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;<br>
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,<br>
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;<br>
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br>
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
My lord, he hath importuned me with love<br>
In honourable fashion.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,<br>
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br>
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br>
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,<br>
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,<br>
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br>
You must not take for fire. From this time<br>
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;<br>
Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br>
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br>
Believe so much in him, that he is young<br>
And with a larger tether may he walk<br>
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,<br>
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br>
Not of that dye which their investments show,<br>
But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br>
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br>
The better to beguile. This is for all:<br>
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,<br>
Have you so slander any moment leisure,<br>
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br>
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
I shall obey, my lord.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt</i><br>

<i>by P.G. Wodehouse</i></p><p>
How strange is Love: I am not one<br />
<span class="indent">Who Cupid's power belittles,</span><br />
For Cupid 'tis who makes me shun<br />
<span class="indent">My customary victuals.</span><br />
Of, Effie, since that painful scene<br />
<span class="indent">That left me broken-hearted,</span><br />
My appetite, erstwhile so keen,<br />
<span class="indent">Has utterly departed.</span>
</p><p>
My form, my friends observe with pain,<br />
<span class="indent">Is growing daily thinner.</span><br />
Love only occupies the brain<br />
<span class="indent">That once could think of dinner.</span><br />
Around me myriad waiters flit,<br />
<span class="indent">With meat and drink to ply men;</span><br />
Alone, disconsolate, I sit,<br />
<span class="indent">And feed on thoughts of Hymen.</span>
</p><p>
The kindly waiters hear my groan,<br />
<span class="indent">They strive to charm with curry;</span><br />
They tempt me with a devilled bone --<br />
<span class="indent">I beg them not to worry.</span><br />
Soup, whitebait, entr&eacute;es, fricasees,<br />
<span class="indent">They bring me uninvited.</span><br />
I need them not, for what are these<br />
<span class="indent">To one whose life is blighted?</span>
</p><p>
They show me dishes rich and rare,<br />
<span class="indent">But ah! my pulse no joy stirs,</span><br />
For savouries I've ceased to care,<br />
<span class="indent">I hate the thought of oysters.</span><br />
They bring me roast, they bring me boiled,<br />
<span class="indent">But all in vain they woo me;</span><br />
The waiters softly mutter, 'Foiled!'<br />
<span class="indent">The chef, poor man, looks gloomy.</span>
</p><p>
So, Effie, turn that shell-like ear,<br />
<span class="indent">Nor to my sighing close it,</span><br />
You cannot doubt that I'm sincere --<br />
<span class="indent">This ballad surely shows it.</span><br />
No longer spurn the suit I press,<br />
<span class="indent">Respect my agitation,</span><br />
Do change your mind, and answer, 'Yes',<br />
<span class="indent">And save me from starvation.</span>

<h6>Welcome to HERG!</h6>
<p>We're glad you've chosen to help us in our efforts to better understand the Hollow Earth and its denizens, PsyPets.</p>
<p>During your trip, please take some time to read this pamphlet to learn more about HERG, its mission, and your role in it.</p>

<h6>About HERG</h6>
<p>Started in March of 2004, HERG, the Hollow Earth Research Group, consists of a handful of scientists who are currently exploring the Hollow Earth, and its peculiar denizens.</p>
<p>HERG is almost exclusively funded by a mysterious, upstart, US-based business.  By working together, HERG and this mysterious company have been able to make take significant strides in quantum mechanics and string theory, particularly where they apply to the Hollow Earth.</p>

<h6>What is the Hollow Earth?</h6>
<p>The classical Hollow Earth theory, largely unsupported, suggests that the Earth is not as we know it - a solid ball with an Iron core - but rather is hollow, with a cloudy sun at its center.  Dwelling within the Hollow Earth, according to believers, are, or were, an advanced alien race.  It is also said to be the resting place of Atlantis and Lumeria.</p>
<p>The Hollow Earth as it is seen today by HERG is not thought to be within the Earth, but "next to" it, like a balloon which has been affixed to space-time's foamy surface.  And living there is not a hyper-intelligent race, but creatures of various shapes and sizes about as intelligent as Earth's ape: PsyPets.</p>

<h6>What Are PsyPets?</h6>
<p>The creatures found in Hollow Earth have been named PsyPets by their discoverers, who have been using simple behavioral psychology as an approach toward understanding them.  Though they almost all appear to be vertebrate, and mostly mammalian, they are as varied as the creatures on our own Earth and have yet to be completely classified.</p>
<p>To assist in studying these strange creatures, individuals such as yourself have been selected to act as their guardians.</p>
<p>When you arrive, HERG director Eve Heidel will give you a quick introduction to the keeping and care of the pet you selected, as well as instructions for how to report your daily progress with the lab.</p>

<strong>Thanks again for joining HERG!  We hope you enjoy your time with us.</strong>

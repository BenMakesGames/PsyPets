  The Two Travelers and the Axe 
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  TWO MEN were journeying together.  One of them picked up
an axe that lay upon the path, and said, "I have found an
axe."
  "Nay, my friend," replied the other, "do not say 'I,' but
'We' have found an axe."
  They had not gone far before they saw the owner of the
axe pursuing them, and he who had picked up the axe said,
"We are undone."
  "Nay," replied the other, "keep to your first mode of
speech, my friend; what you thought right then, think right
now.  Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone."

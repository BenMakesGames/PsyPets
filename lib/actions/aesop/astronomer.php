  The Astronomer
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  AN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the
stars.  One evening, as he wandered through the suburbs
with his whole attention fixed on the sky, he fell
accidentally into a deep well.  While he lamented and
bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for help,
a neighbor ran to the well, and learning what had happened
said:  "Hark ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into
what is in heaven, do you not manage to see what is on
earth?"

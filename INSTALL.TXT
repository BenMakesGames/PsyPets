your very own pet game, based on psychology!

here's what you need to do:

=== SERVER REQUIREMENTS =======================================================

* PHP, with "short tags" enabled
* MySQL
* memcached (although you could probably edit it out of the code pretty easily)

=== DATABASE AND OTHER SETTINGS ===============================================

* configure libraries/settings.php
* configure commons/settings_light.php

unfortunately, PsyPets used two different libraries to connect to the database.
HandyDB is the newer, fancy method which uses better, faster functions; its
settings are in library/settings.php.  the code which uses the older functions
uses the settings in commons/settings_light.php  there are a lot of other
settings in commons/settings_light.php which you should be sure to configure,
as well, including domain name, cookies, and others.

also:

* commons/settings.php
    may have system-specific values you need to modify
* meta/privacy.php
    your privacy policy goes here (how do you use users' email addresses?) and
		be sure to note that the site uses cookies to maintain their sessions
* commons/tos.php
    should be edited to have the site's Terms of Service
* commons/abuseexamples.php
    references some rules in the ToS
* help/design-philosophies.php
    what direction do you wish to take the game with your future developments?

=== CREATE DATABASE TABLES ====================================================

you'll find everything in:

* db_structure.sql
* db_globals.sql

=== SIGN UP; GIVE YOURSELF ADMINISTRATIVE RIGHTS ==============================

once you've got things working, sign up and log in. if you're having trouble
activating your account, you can manually activate it by modifying your user
data in the monster_users table.

to give yourself admin rights, create an entry in the monster_admins table.
some of the fields are very old and no longer used, but the field names are
hopefully self-explanatory.

test out your administrative powers at www.YOURSITE.COM/admin/tools.php

=== CREATE... EVERYTHING ======================================================

you will need to upload your own graphics, and create all of the items and
recipes which appear in the game.

a COUPLE of the admin tools provide interfaces for this, but even some of those
are old and do not work properly. it is probably best to edit things in the
database directly (I recommend installing phpMyAdmin!)

some database tables to get started on:

* monster_items
    contains all of the game's item definitions
* monster_monster and monster_prey
    contains the monsters and prey which your pets may adventure/hunt
* monster_recipes
    contains recipes which players can prepare
* psypets_jewelry (and many others)
    contains crafting information for the pets

<h5>People Who May Play</h5>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a> tells me that players under the age of 13 may not sign up.  Sorry :(</p>
<p>Things You Must Do</p>
<!--

make up your own ToS here.

I like to phrase things as "here's what you CAN do" rather than "here's what you CAN'T".  people don't like being told what
they CAN'T do, after all :)

from personal experience, I recommend against any kind of mechanics regarding warning/banning, etc. ex: if you tell people
"you will be banned if you break the rules three times in a month", then SOME people - the really difficult ones you'll learn
to hate dealing with - will make sure they break the rules exactly two times in a month. when you finally have to ban this
person anyway, you'll look like a meany-head for breaking your own rules.

keep in mind: 99.9% of your players will be good, honest, AWESOME people, who will never (intentionally) break the rules.
(assuming your rules are simple and sensible, which they should be!)  you don't need complicated rules on how banning works
for those 99.9% of the people. it's the 0.1% who WANT to cause trouble, and who will game whatever punishment system you come
up with. don't give these people a system to game! just ban them.

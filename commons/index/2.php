<p>Good to meet you.  I'm Thaddeus.</p>
<p>I was hired by HERG to consult on various aspects of Hollow Earth, but I also run an alchemy shop for the people here.</p>
<p>Hm?  What's HERG?  The Hollow Earth Research Group.  They rediscovered the Hollow Earth in 2004, and the creatures living there: the PsyPets.</p>
<p>PsyPets are highly intelligent, capable not only of hunting and fishing, but of smithing, jeweling, and a bit of magic-binding.</p>
<p>Even with my help, studying these creatures has been a lot of work, so HERG recruits people such as yourself to help out.</p>
<p>Interested in joining?</p>

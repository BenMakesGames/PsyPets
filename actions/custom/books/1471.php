on PsyPets since forever<br />
<br />
Playing since before 4am on 4/4/04, when account creation dates were first added to the game. That so many fours were involved was, believe it or not, an accident. <br />
<br />
Despite being the sole programmer of PsyPets, That Guy Ben knows relatively little about the game. He rarely plays, opting instead to play other games and watch anime and other shows, stealing ideas from them to put into PsyPets. In his spare time, That Guy Ben enjoys food, music, and, at the time of this writing, lots and lots of girls. Why he would choose to divulge this kind of information for a large publication is unclear.<br />

Ahreinya is an ancient spider who lives in a creaky old elm, and is best glimpsed when the veil between the worlds thins. Her favorite past-time is stretching thin sticky webs across paths so that humans will unknowingly walk into them and begin hopping madly about. Within her web she collects all things mystical, and most times just can't be bothered to do much besides bask in the moonlight.<br />

AndAliceSays, a.k.a Faye, is an oft-ignored member of the Psypets community, and for good reason! A self-proclaimed music-whore and general geek, she can usually be found on Dofus if not on Psy, avoiding university work. When not extolling the virtues of some new band no one cares about, she’s prone to joining in arguments late, and participating in any threads that degenerate into conversations about sex, invariably giving too much information about her own sex life. In-game activities include collecting way too many pets, and constantly re-naming them all in the vein of some new concept album. A huge fan of the Fairy Dragon club, she's still waiting hopefully (but in vain) for Artemisa's return.<br />

<br />
Her interests include art, writing, animals -especially cats- and music, as well as roleplaying, when she can be roused from her semi-retired state. If you have a question about how to do things, she would most probably help you. However, she doesn't respond to begging.<br />

However, she was banned from the computer for several days, and when she returned, almost all of her pets had died. She then left PsyPets for several months.<br />
<br />
Upon returning to Psy, she found it a changed place. All of her pets had been revived, and everything worked differently! Pets could get pregnant! Crafts required materials! New items were everywhere! And her pets could suddenly gather all the food they needed! She decided to stay after that point, and has played PsyPets regularly ever since. She is now trying to merge back into the community, though she will probably always be quiet, mostly friendly, and fairly unassuming.<br />

Hara is a squishy, cuddly, and fairly unaggressive resident of PsyPets; however, if provoked Hara will act out of defense. Hara is often portrayed as a panda in reference to his panda avatar. He often refers to the picture on the avatar as the &quot;HaraPanda&quot;. But, and this is a little known fact, he didn't even make the avatar or the item to begin with, he bought it. Hara is also an advocate of pirates' rights and has spent many years serving on the pro-pirate side of the on-going war between the pirates and the ninjas. At the time of this writing Hara has another avatar that is sometimes used: a skull &amp; crossbones from the One Piece manga. Hara loves One Piece. One Piece is about pirates. <br />
<br />
Hara also loves computer games. As a fan of every Elder Scrolls game ever made, Hara will become extremely nerdy when speaking on the subject and has been known to go on for hours about it. As pertaining to art, Hara has been known to dabble in drawing. A few examples of his work can be seen in places such as the Graffiti Wall or used as custom graphics. Some other residents of Psy affectionately refer to his art as &quot;HaraArt&quot;. Most importantly, Hara is taller than KSmall.<br />

Ketia is in love with chocolate roses. Therefore, she attempts to save each one her pets skillfully create. Ketia is devastated when she reads in pets logs that a chocolate rose had been destroyed by a disobedient pet when there is plenty of other food available. At this moment, she has dutifully saved 45 out of the 1340 in the game. Ketia's dream is to triple the amount of chocolate roses she owns. Perhaps, some may say she is compensating for something. But the truth of the matter is, she just loves the fantasy of having multitudes of chocolate roses at her side.<br />

Lune is a female creature with an obsessive hoarding of pretty items problem and is believed to have minor artistic capabilities. When encountering Lune in the wild, it's recommended to drop a couple of pretty artworks, mirrors, coins, shards of glass, small giamonds, etc., and run away before it gets too emotional and/or clingy. Do not, under any circumstances, play dead. The Lune will take your body to its unholy lair and do unnatural things to it.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Ahreinya</span></span></span><br />
Ahreinya is a semi-lurker at Psy; an oldbie who is generally friendly, if somewhat apathetic to Psy-drama. She is often forgetful and needs to be poked once in awhile to get things done. Please tell her to stop looking for her glasses (and remind her that she doesn't wear any).<br />
<br />

...in words, Psy spirit reminds me of a lava lamp. Most times we stick together, but at times we drift apart temporarily. The atmosphere changes, but something new is formed in the process. We all do our own thing, we're our own people, but still have the pleasant community in common.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Unsung thinks that Ahreinya, from what I can tell, is a sweet, gentle person with a huge heart.<br />
--<br />
Silent_J thinks that Ahreinya is a wonderful person and I have enjoyed her posts. She is definitely someone I would be saddened to see go!<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Alisa</span></span></span><br />
As someone walks down the street, they feel a sharp object being pressed to their back. "Give me all your loot!" the voice says. They cautiously peer over their shoulder to see a brown patch of fur belonging to what seems to be a rabbit. They slowly turn around with their hands in the air, and notice that the bunny is holding a scimitar, waving it menacingly. The bunny has a patch over one eye and is dressed in what appears to be pirate fashion.<br />
Sadly, they give the bunny all of their valuables, and she hops away, loot in hand. They were the fourth victim in what appears to be a string of robberies committed by the infamous Pirate Bunny Alisa. Anyone with information is urged to contact authorities. So far, she has eluded all attempts of capture.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Psy has softened. It used to be kind of like a jungle. Instead of 'survival of the fittest', though, it was 'survival of the bitchiest'. Now it's soft and all the wrong players are socially accepted. FAIL.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
FaileV is certain a little bunny buccaneer has been taking her veggies for booty.<br />
--<br />
Banditman5 says Alisa is teh awesome-est pirate bunny evah.<br />
--<br />
Rika thinks Alisa is one of her best buddies on Psypets. ;D<br />
--<br />
Unsung says Alisa is a very pretty pirate bunny who definitely has an attitude, but that totally works for her!<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje says that when you read Alisa's posts, you'd never say she was only 14.<br />
--<br />
Ahreinya thinks that Alisa is quite nice.<br />
--<br />
Dominique says Alisa is a pirate bunny and a real friend. She's always so mature (mostly).<br />
--<br />
Silent_J thinks that Alisa is definitely one goofy pirate bunny and although SJ has always had a thing for being ninja, she'll never let her ninja-ness interfere with Alisa's pirate pirating! Pirate on Pirate Bunny!<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Anabel</span></span></span><br />
Constantly reiterating an annoyingly redundant point that her real name is not the same as her resident name, Anabel is very odd. She often wonders how she's managed to stay for this long on psypets given that she lacks brainpower. She loves oranges IRL and on psypets, as well as disco balls, graphing calculators, and Wand of Wonders. Of course, everytime she finds a WoW, she uses it. Force of habit. Granted it doesn't come around so much that it can be called a habit...<br />
No one actually cares about Anabel, so she can say anything about herself. Although she has been around on psypets longer than a few well-knowns of the plaza, she mainly sticks to herself. Unless she has an uncontainable stupid comment that she will later regret posting. Or unless she wants to show off her two lovely avatars drawn by another lovely psypets resident. She is a packrat and is afraid of change. That's why when people leave, she becomes sad. And scared. Anabel admires those who have stayed around long enough to understand the game. Anabel is not one of them. Anabel has a nostalgia for old psypets.<br />
Anabel also has a soft heart sometimes for certain players that she thinks are nice. Anabel likes to help nice people when she gets enough moneys. Anabel talks too much. Shut up, Anabel!<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Anabel wonders what to contribute that she thinks portrays Psypet's spirit to her. Anabel does not know how to send herself through cyberspace, so Anabel has nothing else to contribute.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Rika would like to note that you should give all your keyrings and oranges to Anabel.<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje would like to mention that Anabel is the owner of the most mysterious PsyPets group (at least to her..).<br />
--<br />
Dominique knows Anabel loves orange and cats like so many cool people. She is also very sweet.<br />
--<br />
Silent_J is unsure if she has ever spoken straight to Anabel..But...She wishes she could share in this lovely, intelligent, creativity she has seen pouring out of Anabel!<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">April</span></span></span><br />
She will eat you. With her stripes she is able to hide in the tall grass unnoticed. When she hops out of the grass and pounces her victims, they let out a scream which is met with licks, tickles and laughter. This beautiful orange-coated, black-striped tiger is a resident of PsyPets, and has been helping newbies since 2005. A very kind and loving person, she is deserving of all your love. (heart)"<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Well, what can I say except that the first day I joined, I was welcomed and treated kindly. I've tried to spread the love in my three (wow, I feel old) years on psypets. Several people have gone above and beyond in order to help me with any problems I've encountered. The most recent act of love was of Dominique. She gave me so much fluff that my house and computer nearly exploded. It was because of her I was able to get my fluffmonger in a few days, when I had been previously working on it for a few months.<br />
I think that one simple act being stated though cannot even paint an accurate picture of the kind things that this community has not only done for me, but for other psypettians. Sure, we've had our share of scammers, but all in all, we pull together and help with not only problems in psypets, but in our own lives outside of this game.<br />
<br />

<br />
Unsung believes April is beautiful, friendly, smart -- this girl pretty much has it all. She's kind and giving and she was one of the first people on PsyPets to give me some small random gift.<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje says that April does a great job at TNG.<br />
--<br />
Feather thinks April is the world's absolute nicest tiger. She's always awesome, and brings amazing fun to the forums. She's really too nice for her own good, but we wouldn't change that about her for the world.<br />
--<br />
Dominique says April is so generous and kind. Everyone should be her friend!<br />
--<br />
Silent_J announces that April is the tiger of my eye! She is such a unique person with a heart full of gold. Her fierce tiger appearance belays the soft-heartedness found underneath that cuddly persona. Once upon a time there was April..and in our hearts, that time will never end. <3<br />
--<br />
Rika comments saying: WHY DOES APRIL HAVE SO FEW COMMENTS??? I shall comment twice to tell her how much I love her.<br />

嵐って言う在住者って、突飛な女なの。彼女はPsypetsの青い猫だよ。優しいけど、お前が馬鹿だったら、お前を殺すかもしれない。Psypetsでは彼女のおっぱいが伝説的って考えられてる。光ってる物やきれいな物などが好き。猫も好き。誕生日は１９８７年１１月１３日だよ。そういう月日を覚えなさい。<br />

<br />
FaileV would like to appease the blue kitty goddess, but hasn't yet figured out the japanese translation to "your boobies are sexah"<br />
--<br />
Banditman5 says Arashi is an awesome person to talk to and hang around.<br />
--<br />
Rika thinks Arashi is really sexy and her Japanese is pwnage.<br />
--<br />
Sarai says Arashi is a great person to chat to and the sexiest cat on the site.<br />
--<br />
Unsung thinks Arashi is beautiful, intelligent, and sexy (because she qualifies as BOTH) -- I'm totally jealous of many aspects of her life, and I think she's a truly amazing person.<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje notes that Arashi is sexy turned human. Need she say more?<br />
--<br />
Ahreinya thinks Arashi is teh awesome!<br />
--<br />
Simpleyetcomplex says Arashi is very kind and spends her time on psy and in Japan. She has many common interests most revolving around one thing and one thing only. She is ubber perfect and Arashi is ubber sexy!<br />
--<br />
Dominique thinks Arashi has the best boobs and the coolest name. She is our resident n00b-squasher.<br />
--<br />
Silent_J is not going to comment on Arashi's chest..As everyone has made it quite clear what it is like! She would like to say that she luvles Arashi...And would be beside herself with worry if her Psyamese twin ever disappeared.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Aspen03</span></span></span><br />
Aspen03 keeps to herself out of fear of embarrassing herself. Although she's been here for a while, she proves herself to be a newbie every time she posts something.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
People who continually put up with the questions I post, directly above posts with the answers. The community of support and acceptance from so many members is why I keep signing on...<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Dominique finds that Aspen03's name makes me thing of clear winter nights around Christmas. I hope to get to know him or her!<br />
--<br />
Silent_J thinks that Aspen is most likely just as wonderful as almost all the other Psypettians and wishes Aspen would come out of lurking much more often.<br />

He has been seen wearing his skull avatar since the dawn of time. He's a regular on the forums and his font is as grey as his skull. He collects various objects, but not much else is known about this mysterious skull, except that he's always been there, lurking in the shadows. He watches everything as it happens, and occasionally leaves his mark on the forums. Don't let the mask fool you, he's on the good side.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Whenever people aren't taking advantage of other people we are always helping each other anonymously and commenting on each other. The group of psy is very tight and helps most residents that aren't annoying and are rude. Such as Misty and Kazo's pets just recently most of psy joined together to see if they could help get the pets back. Or when Ben needed a new server the whole psypets bought favors for it and the server was paid for in a week. <span style="color:white">find me.mail me</span><br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Arashi also wanted to include this description of Banditman5. He often ninjas his way through the plaza and into our hearts. His dreary avatar and rain cloud-colored font may seem menacing at a very speedy glance, but this sweetheart is possibly one of the greatest friends you could possibly have; when you're down and out, he's quick to bring cheer. of all the people on psy, he could easily be considered as one of the most sensible and down-to-earth. to all of you prime significant other candidates out there, you better snag him while you still can -- you don't want to lose out on one of the last remaining gentlemen that this world has to offer!<br />
--<br />
Banditman5 says he commented on myself!<br />
--<br />
Unsung says Banditman5 is nice, funny and giving. He's always willing to help out someone in need.<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje is glad that Banditman has become more active.<br />
--<br />
TomaTori says Skully is nice and amusing and a great way to kill time, which is odd since when she thinks of skeletons she thinks of things that are scary and creepy and out to kill her... In Skully's case she just gets "SKULLY! <3".<br />
--<br />
Dominique says that Banditman5 is able to stay above the drama. Even when he's so quiet we all know he's smart.<br />
--<br />
Silent_J loves her Bandit and thinks he is absolutely wonderful. She is glad he chats so often and finds his straightfoward personality to be quite refreshing!<br />

A nice, slightly annoying, nice person.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Brooke Marie is a Psypettian! What more can you ask for?!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Rika thinks Brooke Marie is a very lovely girl who likes squishing tomatoes. Rika also wants to add that Brooke Marie is in her top five!<br />
--<br />
Sarai says Brooke Marie is the coolest kid I've met and an awesome flower giver.<br />
--<br />
Unsung thinks this little girl has a cute personality and a great sense of humor. Someday, she's going to grow up into a really cool adult.<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje would like to add that Brooke Marie is the only person to ever make it off her ignore list.<br />
--<br />
Dominique says Brooke Marie is a super Kansas girl. She is like the little sister I never had.<br />
--<br />
Silent_J doesn't talk to Brooke Marie a lot, but when she has, she's had nothing but pleasant conversations with the her. You rock Brooke!<br />

Silent_J thinks Caleby is just full of awesome. She says she lurks, but I feel like I see her everywhere! Maybe it's just my imagination...Maybe it's because I need to see more of Caleby!<br />

Giraki thinks that Caleby rocks the Psyworld. I loooove her Peep-in-a-Box Costume!<br />

Carm3n is the shiz-nit for someone of her age and is one of the few 'kids' on Psy that some of the oldbies can actually be around without killing her. She has an awesomely random mind that comes up with many ideas and she even has her own Castle of Cool!<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Carm3n is a Psypettian! What more can you ask for?!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Unsung says being a fellow Ohioan, Carm3n is a very nice young lady and she will grow into a beautiful young woman with a charming personality.<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje thinks Carm3n deserves huggles.<br />
--<br />
Dominique finds Carm3n is such a sweet kid. I love her silly take on stuff.<br />
--<br />
Silent_J thinks Carm3n reminds her of her little sister..But a much better version of her little sister..A version that doesn't include bratty-ness. <3<br />

A guide to what Psypets is when I came...<br />
Is this the "true" sanctuary to what people said? Is this the untouched website where life is easy?...NO!!! Your first day maybe your last. Watch out! Pay attention and keep out of trouble! It's a jungle in here.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Dominique thinks Changcuters has never seemed that stupid to me. He or she seems to learn from his or her mistakes.<br />
--<br />
Silent_J thinks Changcuters is cool because they always seem to be off on their own world..A world that I bet none of us would be able to handle from the short glimpses I have seen of it!<br />

Chelz is a fun-loving, somewhat sarcastic person sitting in a grey office chair. Why it is grey, she does not know. She enjoys fishing, swimming, hiking, video gaming, and the Internet. She has an addiction to zucchini, sunflower seeds, capuchino, super dark chocolate, and french toast. She also likes to poke the innards of garden snails that attempt to eat the leaves off a zucchini plant; BUT THEY FAIL TO DO SO BECAUSE OF MY POWER POKE!....Did I say my? I meant her. I'm not chelz, I swear. Nope Nope. >_>. I think that's all that I can tell you now before I slip up again. Wait, I didn't slip up 'cause I'm not chelz, RIGHT?! Yes yes......not her.<br />

Of psypettia I shall tell,<br />
Do not be impish, rude, or pissy;<br />
Do be kind, magnimonious, and perhaps kissy.<br />
'Live long and prosper!' says one,<br />
'Long live prosperous days!' says another,<br />

Alisa would like to set the record straight that CHELZ IS COOL, ON THE OTHERHAND, IS A NAME STEALING DOUCHEBAG. <_<...>_><br />
--<br />
Silent_J would like to re-set the record that of course..Alisa joking..And that Chelz is pretty much absolute coolness. <3<br />

Dominique thinks that Chelz is cool is, well, cool. She seems very child-like and fun.<br />

CJ is a criminal lurker. On occasion she'll come out of hiding to make long winded posts about nothing or make an insignificant reply to a larger conversation. She rarely makes topics, for topic-making is dangerous business best left to the professionals.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
The Psypets community, judging by how they give out their shiny gold stars, are people who appreciate everything from sexually mischievous posts to well-meant advice, but never intentional stupidity.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Silent_J applauds CJ for her bravery on coming out of lurker status to post occasionally as Silent has found that many lurkers are frightened by this very aspect. Silent would like to mention that CJ has always seemed to be a very calm, cool and collected individual and she hopes to see even more of her!<br />
--<br />
Giraki must point out that CJ makes awesome contributions to the authors of Psy. CJ makes constructive comments and spices up the Graffiti Wall!<br />

Dominique is a bit on the flighty side, but loves to help. Although she can sometimes be really mean, she tries hard to at least be honest. Dominique loves butterflies and cats, and loves to spend a lazy afternoon taking a nap!<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Elwingelfje gave me a Clear Lava Lamp. Those are in extremely high demand, and she gave me one just because I was upset one day. That, to me, is the true spirit of Psypets; giving to and helping others because you want us all to succeed. Even with all the snark and drama, which can be invigorating for the site, friendship is just as important.<br />

--<br />
Unsung believes Domi is an insanely generous, kindhearted person who deserves all the happiness in the world. She's sweet, smart and funny, not to mention talented and cute.<br />
--<br />
Lenna would like to add that Dominique is a very, very, extremely sweet person that might give you cavaties from her excessive generosity and kindness. She's willing to go out of her way to help someone in need and is just a cool, well repsected person overall. Sorry, my words don't do her justice. :[<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje thinks that Dominique is the funnest person to ever send gifts to.<br />
--<br />
Ahreinya thinks Dominique is very generous!<br />
--<br />
Dominique is a horrible monster who will eat your candy and steal your puppies for her own puppy-huffing addiction!<br />
--<br />
Silent thinks Domi is silly as huffing puppies does not seem like a very possible thing to do..Although, Domi is just SO awesome that she probably can pull it off. Silent will now become very wary around Domi when Silent is accompianied by a puppy.<br />

Dominique thinks Duski can draw like the shiznizz! She is also very polite.<br />
--<br />
Silent finds Duski to be an absolutely wonderful person. She is supremely nice and willing to help out whenever someone is in need of artisticalness. Silent wonders how she was ever able to live without her Duski. <3<br />

A usually peace-loving resident with a strange preference for owls, triceratopses, citrus fruit and olives. Is known to bite till she hits bone when provoked.<br />

<br />
Dominique thinks Elwingelfje has the prettiest real name. She is also super smart and speaks better English, as a second language, than I do!<br />
--<br />
Silent always gets tongue-tied when trying to say Elwingelfje's name Elwingelfje outloud. Despite this, Silent finds her to be absolutely wonderful and continues trying everyday to correctly pronounce this name of hers!<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">FaileV</span></span></span><br />
Started out life in a hole. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole. It wasn't even a hobbit hole despite where that sentence was headed. It was in fact a fox hole (the sort that foxes actually live in, not the kind with a suspicious lack of athiests). She had a lovely childhood really, filled with plenty of interesting family stories. Some were about her grandfather, who wasn't terribly liked, in fact he was such an ass most were suprised he didn't bray, the family told stories of how his bad turns always came back to bite him, like when he had dinner with the crane, or the time he trapped a goat in a well. It seemed fitting when he finally lost his tail in a trap and went into hiding.<br />
Her southern cousin wasn't much better, always complaining about some rabbit that really wanted to be in the briar patch, he was a bit stupid. The best stories were about her uncle, others called him the Fantastic Mister Fox. His stories were always dramatic tales of charm and wit, she was always on edge when he told the one where the farmer filled up his hole.<br />
With such an interesting background Faile ventured out to have her own adventures and ended up in this funny little psyworld, where pets do everything, and there are the most interesting people, like a flying wolf, japanese speaking blue cat, a talking pizza, a crow weasle thing, and it's all run by a guy that looks suspiciously like Ichabod Crane.<br />
<br />
She is now a Literature major, and an aspiring writer, with hopes of future studies in Folktales and Mythology.<br />
<br />

Banditman5 says that despite FaileV's name, she doesn't fail.<br />
--<br />
Rika thinks FaileV reads a lot of books. Like a lot. A lot lot. Like 7 books a week. She also has awesome hats. b(^__^)d<br />
--<br />
Unsung believes FaileV is so incredibly win when it comes to her art skills. She's also a generous, intelligent person that I would like to get to know better.<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje says that FaileV has the best naming algorithm ever.<br />
--<br />
Feather believes FaileV is an amazing artistic little foxy. Witty and kind, she brings all sorts of great things to our Psypettian lives.<br />
--<br />
Dominique wants to note that FaileV is our resident fox-type creature. Her fluffy tail and English skills make me wish I could adopt her and take her on walks with a little harness with wings.<br />
--<br />
Silent likes Faile. Silent really likes Faile. Silent really thinks Faile is pretty. Faile should talk to Silent more so they can discuss Faile-Silent things!<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Giraki27</span></span></span><br />
Giraki27 is the Mystical Turtle of Pineapples. She amazes people with her ability to turn into a turtle. Giraki also hoards all known Psypet Pineapples. If you value your pineapples, please disguise them from her! Make sure you never mention Turtle Soup in her lovely turtle presence either as it often causes her to hide and spin out of control. However, the Mystical Turtle of Pineapples loves getting koi plushies and flowers filled with love. They are beautiful in her garden <3<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
This was a little hard to come up with! However, I think there are some important things about the PsyPet's spirit that I would like to share. Over the past few weeks I have spent time chatting with fellow Psypettians and getting to know them better. I can't explain how close I feel to a lot of the Psy community and how much it means to me <img src="gfx/emote/hee.gif" alt="[happy]" border=0 /> Eric2311 (My husband) was welcomed by so many of you that I was overwhelmed by the response. All of you guys rock! PsyPets spirit thrives on the kindness and hope behind every user's heart.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Sarai says Giraki is awesome to chat to....whenever.<br />
--<br />
Schweppes thinks Giraki is a sweetheart who deserves lots of hugs.<br />
--<br />
Unsung says TURDLE TURDLE!! Giraki is a sweet, intelligent, kind and beautiful person. It's been a lot of fun getting to know her through our MSN conversations, though we've not had many. She's suggested some books I should read, and it's just nice getting to talk about books with someone else. <3<br />
--<br />
Elwingelfje wants Giraki to know that she can stalk her anytime.<br />
--<br />
TomaTori thinks the Turtle Shaped Crayon is very friendlifuls and amusing. It gets a little confusing when she branches into three colors, but I guess that just means her awesomeness can't be contained within just one color?<br />
--<br />
Ahreinya says Giraki is sweet.<br />
--<br />
Feather admits that the community of Psypets has admittedly been rather worried about Giraki. We're not sure if a steady diet of pineapples is the best thing for a person. But we surely love her anyway (although we might suggest some sort of support groupâ�¦). She and her turtles are sure to produce smiles wherever they appear.<br />
--<br />
Dominique has found that Giraki27 has never steered me wrong. She is always kind and sweet, even to people who don't deserve her kindness.<br />
--<br />
Silent loves her Giraks...She is the most fantabulous person on Psy..I've enjoyed talking to her more and more and am thankful that we had the chance to to actually get to know each other.. Both her and her husband are SO much fun! I never want my Giraki to leave Psy and her husband needs to know..That I am going to steal Giraki...One of these days...<3<br />
--<br />
Giraki is a silly person and says she is the most awesomest psy player IN THE WORLD. She rocks my bed all night long <img src="gfx/emote/nyeh.gif" alt="[razz]" border=0 /><br />

G0H is one of the more crazy cool silent types found on Psy. She can be found half-lurking, half-posting most anywhere you find Psypettians. She also has a gonormous collection of pets, already past the 800 mark. But don't let me steer you wrong...This girl does a FABULOUS job raising her pets, being one of the first Psy members to own an Electrum Chalice!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Guardian 0f Heaven is a Psypettian! What more can you ask for?!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />

Ahreinya thinks G0H is helpful.<br />
--<br />
Feather wants to know how could we not love our gorgeous Guardian 0f Heaven and her hordes of pets? She gives us advice when we need it. Gives us babies whether we need them or not, and gives us kind comments whenever she can.<br />
--<br />
G0H...Silent thinks you are awesome. Otherwise, she wouldn't have tried convincing you to fill out an entry for here..And when you didn't turn one in, due to lack of knowing what to say..Silent was unconvinced because she had tons to say about you! Hance you're wonderful entry of funness. X D<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Harmonica</span></span></span><br />
You never see much of this little Psypettian, as she seemingly wonders from forum to forum, posting whenever she gets the whim. She is an intelligent person though, with artistic abilities to boot and has a name that comes straight out of the harmonious melody of the winds...<br />
<br />

<br />
Feather knows Harmonica hasn't been here very long, but we love her just the same. She brings lovely music to our Psy community, and has a fun sense of humor that's all her own.<br />
--<br />
Dominique thinks Harmonica has a very pretty name. She also has the cutest cotton candy cat on her profile.<br />
--<br />
Silent finds Harmonica to be very harmonious to the Psy atmosphere!<br />

<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Silent has enjoyed the posts of this lovely individual. They always have a polite manner about them and oddly enough, Silent loves there name!<br />
--<br />
Giraki is in debt to Insorak. Even as a newbie he was sending little gifts of fluff and selling paper cranes for decent prices. Insorak has been a great addition to our Psy community!<br />

Beyond the land of Rainbows and all that is pink and glittery lives a little Neko named InvaderMe0w. She goes by Me0w for short. She's obsessed with all things Irish, Drinking, and Felines. Especially ones that are pink in color. She enjoys lavishing herself in expensive pretties in the land of Psypets and she loves all of her little critters who bring her back stuff.<br />

Rika would like to say that when I was a whee little newbie, I worshipped the Pink Cat. I still greatly admire and respect her. What made me love her so much was her ability to speak her mind. I was still really shy about telling people how I really felt.<br />
--<br />
Silent luvles Me0w..She has been around since back when Silent started and has always found her neon pink appearance to be absolutely lovely, despite Silent's lack of love for the color.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Lady Silverspirit</span></span></span><br />
Lady Silverspirit (Or LSS as she is known by most of the Psy Communtiy) runs a small help group, she picks a new resident a week, sometimes twice a week, and sends them pillows, food and random stuff to help them get started. It's not much, but she tries and we are sure she is loved for this.<br />
<br />
She is strong minded and traditional. She is honest and she has a big heart.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Lady Silverspirit is a Psypettian! What more can you ask for?!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Unsung believes LSS is a kind and generous soul. She's had her moments, but everyone gets grumpy. I admire her strength and hope that if I'm ever in a situation, I can be as strong as she is. Sure she's stubborn, but she knows when to apologize and once you get through her semi-rough exterior, there's a cuddly soft lady inside, waiting to embrace you.<br />
--<br />
Ahreinya thinks LSS is full of fun.<br />
--<br />
Feather says LadySilverspirit always makes people smile. Telling people to have a beautiful day, and giving encouragement. Psy wouldn't be the same without her here- we hope we'll never have to know what that's like.<br />
Oh, and we all love her random water balloons!<br />
--<br />
Dominique thinks LadySilverspirit is like a ball of fluff. She is considerate and fights for justice!<br />
--<br />
Silent admires LSS for her strength and her conviction. She's not afraid to say what's on her mind and if she or one of her friends is being treated unfairly, you better believe you're in for a world of hurt!<br />

She is a weird eccentric crazy gal. She is also nice and sincere but be careful because sometimes she is too honest. She loves to do banners in Gimp. But she is completely dazed sometimes so that she forgets stuff very easily.<br />

Silent sometimes confuses Lenneth with Lenna. But both have their differences! Lenneth is a sweet, lovely person and Psy is so grateful and jealous of her banners. Thanks Lenneth!<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Misty21</span></span></span><br />
Misty, contrary to former popular belief, is an incredibly kind, caring and giving person. She has a deep love of her pretty little pixels, and she really does play the game to play with her pets. She watches them grow and gets excited about her ability to mold them and help them reach their full potential. She also enjoys other pursuits, such as WoW. She never hesitates to help a friend, but that's not what makes her a truly great friend. She listens, she cares, she helps. --Unsung Lullaby<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
PsyPets is a giving, caring community, but it has definitely changed a lot in the last few years. One of the fun parts of Psy is the competitive nature of the game, seeing who can get more and how fast. It's a game I can play in any way I want, and that's what makes it worth it.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />
<br />
Unsung thinks Misty is an incredibly kind and giving person and I simply have to thank her for all she has done for me over the last couple of months.<br />

Silent finds Misty to be a wonderful person and I really wish she hadn't gone so quiet lately. Silent would like to thank Misty for everything she has done for our Psy community.<br />

Moon Cat can often be found polishing her rectangles or<br />
writing lists about things that no normal human would make lists for.<br />
She also enjoys coffee, rectangles, making cakes, rectangles, helping people and RECTANGLES!!<br />
Moon Cat loves her pets very much, and enjoys organising all the things they get her.<br />
In the real world *gasp* she mostly looks after her children, watches childrens DVDs and worries too much about everything.<br />

I dont think that i have been to a site where people seem to care so much for each other (most of the time <img src="gfx/emote/nyeh.gif" alt="[razz]" border=0 />) and its amazing to see how people rally round to help out others with various things (like obsessive rectangle collections.. *cough*)<br />
For example, of my (near) 1000 rectangles, less than 100 are my own, or ones i have bought. So thank you everyone <img src="gfx/emote/anime.gif" alt="[happy]" border=0 /><br />

--<br />
Rika says Moon Cat is the goddess of all the golden rectangles in the world. Why she is collecting them, I don't know. Will it be used for evil? Or will it be used for good? What will happen when she finally gets 1000 of them? D8 But anyways, she's really nice and really pretty and really smart and her husband looks like King Leonidas from 300. =D<br />
--<br />
Ahreinya thinks Moon Cat is great and not at all catty!<img src="gfx/emote/wink.gif" alt="[wink]" border=0 /><br />
--<br />
Feather believes Moon Cat is an amazing person here on Psy. Although it is rather odd that a cat looks so much like a fox. But that doesn't really bother anyone for long, since they're too busy admiring Moon Cat's collection of Golden Rectangles to notice.<br />
--<br />
Silent thinks Moon Cat is like...The awesome..And I know if I had rectangles lying around, I'd give them all to her in LESS than a heartbeat. Moon Cat is so the shiz-nit. <3<br />

Even though I'm a nobody, I understand not to do stupid things to make everyone hate me xD.<br />

Elwingelfje says that Person is very helpful and nice.<br />

TomaTori would like to add that the Bread is a common partier inside the Storage Monster's stomach. Its kind of funny how the Bread is still whole after prolonged exposure to stomach acid, but I guess that's just some sort of invincible awesomeness.<br />
--<br />
Dominique thinks Person Dx always has the clover avatar, which makes me happy. I think this person is a person for people-persons.<br />
--<br />
Silent thinks Bread (or Person as many know her as) is a positively joyful thing to eat..She is a wonderful partier and I have always enjoyed having her party in my stomach. But for serious, I love this kid. She's so awesome.. <3<br />

<br />
Dominique thinks Potatoe-San is a bit edgy for a young girl. However, she has grown and matured very well over the months.<br />
--<br />
Silent thinks Potatoe-San is a very strong-minded person. I don't talk to her often, but I do enjoy the randomness of some of her posts!<br />
--<br />
Rika says Potatoe-San shall continue to grow and learn and become a beautiful young women someday.<br />

Psycho created his user name a long time ago, during a rather dark time in his life, so don't be intimidated by it! He is always looking for something new to learn about and loves change in general. And his pets are all below average, especially for their age. This is probably due to the year-long hiatuses he takes from time to time.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
Psycho learns a lot of useless stuff. He learned binary. This is how you write Psypets in binary.<br />
01010000 01110011 01111001 01110000 01100101 01110100 01110011<br />

Silent thinks Psycho is a pretty cool Psypettian. His avi is what I identify him most by, which is definitely not the only wonderful thing about this guy! You rock kid!<br />

Rika thinks iRabbit! Rika still calls her iRabbit. Raintown shall always be Rika's lovely invisible rabbit.<br />
--<br />
Dominique says Raintown draws like kickass stuff. She is also a person who only posts when she means to.<br />
--<br />
Silent loves Raintown's name as it reminds her of a lovely place full of rain clouds and rain drops..The sound of thunder and the smell of water dripping from the skys...Raintown is <3 for me.<br />

Raquella is a energetic person that likes to talk a lot and is always laughing at herself... and others... and everything! She is also an animal LOVER but, sadly, she's not a vegetarian.<br />

...um, well, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">I LOVE PSYPETS!!!</span> It's great! There's a lot to do, I get to talk with other people, it has freedom of speech, and I get to satisfy my desire of taking care of pets!<br />

Giraki is pleased to talk about Raquella. Raquella's enthusiasm for psy is refreshing and appreciated by the community at large, including giraki <img src="gfx/emote/hee.gif" alt="[happy]" border=0 /><br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">Rika</span></span></span><br />
She likes drawing dragons and birds. Her favorite color is #607B8B (pale-grey-blue), #CDCDCD (silver), #FFFFFF (white), and #000000 (black). Her favorite spelling of the color grey, is grey. Often she doesn't like very much color. She also doesn't like sound very much and would prefer the silence, which is why she likes silencers and suppressors. When she does listen to music, she likes calm soothing music more than loud music. Her current favorite song is Duvet by Boa. It makes her calm. She also likes Ode to Joy and the Stargate SG-1 Intro Song. The animal representation she chooses and her logo is a small blue bird.<br />

Alisa says although she seems like an innocent little girl, Rika is truly evil. Off of PsyPets, she shares with us her interets: including guns and gun silencers. Rika: Tea Queen or Disgruntled Teen?<br />
--<br />
FaileV believes Rika was born in a cabbage patch somewhere, a sugar cabbage patch, with faeries and unicorns. Believe it or not, her personality is actually very pessimistic compared to that of her childhood in the garden of sugary sweetness.<br />
--<br />
Banditman5 says Rika tries so hard to make Psypets as a whole happy.<br />
--<br />
Sarai thinks that 'Generosity' doesn't begin to cover it.<br />
--<br />
Ahreinya says that Rika is very nice and helpful.<br />
--<br />
Dominique says Rika is my bestest birdie friend. She gives me tea and I give her love.<br />
--<br />
Silent thinks Rika is the most awesomest person. She has a lovely writing style and has an even more lovely personality, accompianied with a creative sense. I luvles the Rika and her Tea-ness!<br />

Opening up the fortune cookie reveals a piece of paper saying: "May fortune fall upon you after reading this." Rika doesn't know Ripvannikki that well, but I think she should eat the cookie and stuff the paper in her pocket and see if anything good comes along.<br />
<br />
--<br />
Silent_J thinks Ripvannikki seems to be a nice person. Silent never really speaks to Ripvannikki, but from what she has read, she has been very nice. She was also thoughtful enough to apologize about sending in her entry so late..Which made me happy. Silent also thinks Ripvannikki should just eat the cookie and keep the fortune.<br />
--<br />
Giraki thinks that Ripvannikki is made of cool. She deserves <3 and huggles from all of Psy for her awesome presence.<br />

FaileV's "summer project" in the Graffiti wall forum. It's the BESTEST image ever!!! And it displays so much pride.<br />
Not my contribution, but FaileV definitely shows Pyspet's Spirit by making this picture.<br />

Along with my last entry of FaileV's picture, I'd like to add the...um...let's call it the Psypets Flower Fight?

A small bunny who ironically hates carrots. Surviving on a steady diet of strawberries, scribbles has developed a light pink coloring. She began small sooty farm, but found herself distraught that her pets bring home the blood of her relatives, the large pink rabbits.<br />
<br />
She appears to harbor a deep grudge against chess. It is unknown what she'll do should she ever obtain a complete set.<br />
<br />

<br />
Rika thinks Scribbles has a cute name.<br />
--<br />
TomaTori thinks Scribbles' addiction to strawberries is very amusing... They're like drugs to her. She even gets withdrawal symptoms.<br />
--<br />
Dominique says Scribbles' name makes me smile. I love to scribble. She is also in my pants. <img src="gfx/emote/ohgod.gif" alt="[eep!]" border=0 /><br />
--<br />
Silent loves Scribbles. In fact, Silent also scribbles. A lot. Silent enjoys scribbling while thinking about Scribbles. Silent wonders exactly what kinds of colors Scribbles is because Silent scribbles all kinds of colors...Scribbles is worthy of rambling about for years..But Silent will stop so as not to bore everyone.<br />

<br />
Rika thinks Schweppes has a wonderful mantle full of purple stockings. She wonders what's in them.<br />
--<br />
Unsung believes Schweppes is another kind soul of PsyPets. She's always willing to lend a helping hand to a friend in need. Like a lot of other PsyPettians, she's beautiful and intelligent, though I have a feeling that if you make her angry she's a force to be reckoned with. Just this feeling I have, though, I've not seen anything to hold that theory up...<br />
--<br />
Feather thinks Schweppes is full of bubbly fizzy goodness. With a creamy center.<br />
Always bringing intelligence, nice words and fun to the vast forums of Psypets. We love our Schweppes.<br />
--<br />
Dominique says Schweppes Purple pop bear to the rescue! I always get thirsty for orange soda when I see her bear.<br />
--<br />
Silent would die for Schweppes' bear's soda..Silent feels that Schweppe must have excellent tast if she chose to be represented by a bear and soda. Silent thinks Schweppe is a pretty awesome Psy player.<br />

Not to be mistaken for Silent Bob of Jay and Silent Bob, this lovely lady has a spunky personality, a kind heart, and mismatched socks. Let's not forget her awesome bangs, and her "monochromatic" icon which distinguishes her from everyone else in quite a lovely way. She works with kids, which keeps her spirit young and her hopes high. She's got initiative and imagination, as well as excellent artistic abilities. Overall, I'd rater has a 100 on a scale of 1-10, because she's a shining star, and so much cooler than that kid over there!<br />

<br />
Unsung says J is fun, creative, and funky. Funky in a good way, not a bad way. She's kind, giving and uber talented. She's fun to talk to, with a great sense of humor and the heart of a child - she knows how to have fun, but she knows how to be serious as well. I've really enjoyed getting to know her through PsyPets!<br />
--<br />
TomaTori says the Storage Monster is made of lovable fluffy goodness, and her fluff makes a nice habitat. She needs to be turned into a plushie, so the love can be spread like a plague throughout the site, minus the whole 'everyone-gets-sick-and-dies' thing. More like the 'creepy-hugging-missionaries-are-coming-to-turn-our-brains-to-mush' kind of plague. <img src="gfx/emote/anime.gif" alt="[happy]" border=0 /><br />
--<br />
Ahreinya thinks Silent_J is awesomeness.<br />
--<br />
Feather knows Silent_J is in ur storage rearranging ur stuffz!<br />
But that's okay. It's always neater than it was before. And now you don't stub your toe when it's dark. So we've decided to keep her around.<br />
Really though. Silent_J is full of amazing.<br />
--<br />
Giraki must contribute something about Silent_J. Her awesomeness goes above and beyond the making of a single book. She is giving and full of fun! My Psyworld would be empty with out her <img src="gfx/emote/hee.gif" alt="[happy]" border=0 /><br />
--<br />
Dominique thinks Silent_J is very kind to make this book. I also think she has very good tastes.<br />
--<br />
Silent would like to say that Silent is pretty awesome..And that according to Eyes, Silent is magic. Magic is always fun..Okay, Silent feels she is done talking about herself now. NEXT!<br />

Simple can be fun and loves to talk with people he has common interests in. He can also be a bitch but hey, thats turning 13! xD<br />
We thought we might as well include his interests also! Psy, Computers, Friends, Sometimes games, Hacking, and Myspace when he typically remembers his email he used to sign up with (Which is rarely)<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
I think the psypets spirit is about giving. Such as when I first signed up wotme gave me some really expensive stuff and I still have most of it. Or when I first started talking to Yikatta I was talking to her and I got her to send me some items she thought would be a good custom. So she did and I turned the into The Evil Scorpion. That is what I feel is the psypets spirit.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103651-1.gif"><br />

--<br />
Dominique believes Simpleyetcomplex has changed so much for the better over time. He makes me smile with his weird ideas.<br />
--<br />
Silent luvles Simple. He helped me create my Wiki page by coding it and constantly offers his help with any project I have going on. Even for his age, I think he is when of the sweetest guys I've met.<br />

Ahreinya says that Spammyann is nice.<br />

Dominique thinks Spammyann has beautiful kids. She is also able to keep any thread going, for better or ill.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span class="size16">TomaTori</span></span></span><br />
Once a Magical Farming Chicken, TomaTori woke up one day to find herself as a tomato-chicken Hybrid. Finding herself a target of hungry KFC fans, TomaTori fled across the internet seeking refuge as well as amusement. When she passed by Psypettia, she stopped for a time, enjoying the company of a young chickie called Clucky until she had to flee again.<br />
By about five or six months later,TomaTori had rid herself of most KFC fanatics, and was free to return to Psypettia; Her six months as a refugee had unfortunately left her permanently paranoid, and she developed a plaza-phobia, of sorts. Isolated from the human population of Psypettia, TomaTori and her chickie wandered, lurking the boards. One day, they came across a chat room where, oddly enough, TomaTori was relatively unaffected by her plaza-phobia.<br />
While there, she witnessed the First Storage Monster appearing out of a Wand of Wonder, and because she got too friendly and huggley with said Storage Monster, ended up falling into the Storage Monster's fluff. Since then, TomaTori has made a home in the fluff, living there under the alias "Eyes".<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k188/moonchild89/coollogo_com_25103555.gif"><br />
TomaTori is unfortunately much too paranoid to consider a PsySpirit entry as the uniqueness of her ceativity might allow someone to discover her.<br />
<br />

Banditman says three words: Best lurker evah.<br />
--<br />
Scribbles thinks that TomaTori is bouncy, funny, paranoid, has a thing for chainsaws, and is too cute to be evil.. though she wishes she were [= . Evil, that is. Toma, also known as clucky to those who have known her during the IO times, takes on the appearance of a vampire tomato-chicken hybrid and feeds off of onions. She doesnt sleep either, hence the vampire part. =P JE T'AIME<br />
--<br />
Silent thinks words can't describe how frakin' awesome TomaTori is, who I frequently refer to as Eyes. Eyes is a wonderful person who's paranoia really gets the best of her sometimes. I don't where I would be without my random late night companion and snuggle buddy...Although it is hard to talk to a pair of eyes sticking out of your random fluff!<br />

Unsung wants everyone to know T0xic is really great - I got him to start playing Psy, and while it's not an obsession for him like it is for me, it gives us some mutual bitching grounds <img src="gfx/emote/anime.gif" alt="[happy]" border=0 /> He's also really great, 'cause he cleans the litter box and takes out the trash, lol. Plus he makes the best damn popcorn I've ever had...<br />
--<br />
Silent thinks T0xic is pretty awesome due to the fact that he is in close contact with Unsung..And Silent is jealous of this fact. She'd like to be close to Unsung! So, continue being awesome T0xic! And wary.. : )<br />

--<br />
Ahreinya feels that Unsung is quite nice and helpful.<br />

Dominique says Unsung Lullaby is my sister-in-spirit. Music and giving follow her steps.<br />

Silent feels that Unsung is a kind spirit which words can not fully encompass the kindness of her heart and the love the eminates from her every pore. Silent would sing this Unsung Lullaby anytime...<br />

Silent enjoys listening to Victor's talks on economy and more serious Psy matters. He sounds like he knows what he's talking about and in the end, it completely makes sense! Victor should show his Ferret-ness more often!<br />

Feather is a crazy little 19 year old who never really grew up. She has a sexy sexy collection of plumage. Feather's presence is not often realized, since she tends to rather enjoy lurking. She does have an odd habit of popping up at unexpected times before disappearing into obscurity again.<br />
Her main pastime appears to be procrastination. Coming up with new and creative ways to do nothing at all takes a surprising amount of time and effort. Other favorites include gaming, drawing, video games and reading. She seems to have an unhealthy obsession with fantasy novels, as can be seen in the fact that nearly all of her pets are named after Wheel of Time characters.<br />
Frustrated at her lack of social skills, Feather once started an organization known as the "Society of Socially Awkward Individuals" Unfortunately, the few people who showed up sat on opposite sides of the meeting room and stared at one another for two hours without speaking. The SSAI was universally regarded as a failure, and Feather has not been seen often in public places since.<br />
A few years ago she underwent a dangerous revolutionary medical procedure that replaced her blood with coffee. All went well, and now Feather lives a happy healthy life as long as she maintains a regular intake of caffeine.<br />

Once upon a time there was a young noob; lets call him George. He wandered in on a dark rainy day, just excited to have found a new game to play. Into the forums he did venture, seeking new friends and maybe a mentor.<br />
"Hmm, Chit-Chat," thought he, "sounds fun! Lets go see." Sex threads, pictures of boobies and oh, the cursing! His poor young eyes, they could not handle it all. Far away from the forums he did flee.<br />
Still, he was determined to stay, although from the forums he kept far away. But Psy was like nothing he'd seen before. Poor George got lost; he knew not what to do. His pets, they did whine, whimper and starve. Gathering his nerve, the young noob decided to brave the forum once more.<br />
"Plz hlp!" was his post. "My pet is no gud. I hav no munny and no food. How do I get sum? Can u giv me nything?" And soon the replies came; but oh! There was no help- only flames.<br />
"Learn some English and read the stickies!"<br />
"Noob! You better read the wiki!"<br />
Here our tale of poor young George comes to an end. He couldn't take the heat, his pets had nothing to eat, and earning money was too great of a feat. The little noob was never seen again.<br />
Twelve months later- to the day!- a box appeared in auction. Many users coveted and bid, but only one user could win. 40,000 m did she pay. Thrilled, she opened to look inside; but to her dismay, only a pamphlet, a clover and a single fluff did she find.<br />
<br />
Let this be a lessen to the wise: in noob butchery you may delight, but of their final revenge take fright!<br />

Harmonic comments that Feather floats on the breath of the discouraged, catching their eye and lifting their spirits.<br />

Unsung doesn't know much about this purple-loving PsyPettian, but I do know that she is kind and generous. She's also very respectful of others, and has a great attitude overall.<br />

Dominique would like to add that xFeatherx collects plumages and happiness. All of her posts are relevant and coherent.<br />

Silent would like Feather to know that I absolutely adore her. Feather is more gorgeous than that lone feather that floats by on the wind and is more graceful in her words than that feather could ever float. <3<br />

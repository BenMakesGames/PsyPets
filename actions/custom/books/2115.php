He Can't See Me Cry          by Kiersty<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Everynight I fall asleep alone in that big ol bed.<br />
He can't see me cry.<br />
Every morning I wake up alone in that big ol bed.<br />
He can't see me cry.<br />
Everyday I wait to hear his voice, hopeing that maybe signal will be<br />
there.<br />
He can't see me cry.<br />
Every moment passes is another moment without him, I cry cause he's not<br />
there.<br />
He can't see me cry.<br />
TO have him, hold and kiss him... would be so wonderful, but I can't.<br />
He can't see me cry.<br />
Feelings flow like rain from swollen thunder clouds, doubt creeps in.<br />
He can't see me cry.<br />
Life is empty here, the dark shows it's ugly head and once again, I<br />
fall asleep alone in that big ol bed.<br />
And he can't see me cry......<br />

Sleep Eludes Me              by Kiersty<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
I sit up droopy eyed, wondering what's there in the dark.<br />
Feeling around for a warm touch, fingertips reaching out to guide me<br />
back to sleep. Nothing there, no loving embrace, no blessed assurance<br />
of another day come and gone and love is in my life. No breaths to<br />
count or listen to, only silence of a cold cold night. Aching heart,<br />
full of pain echos a beat of a distand\t emptyness, like a tree falling<br />
in the woods, with no one there to hear it's cries for help.<br />
Noone there to hold, caress, noone there to cry to, noone there to see<br />
me.... do I deserve this lonlieness? Am I not wonderful enough? Do I<br />
deserve to be alone? Fate won't even take my hand, I suppose that in<br />
the end, I'm destined to walk alone... *sigh* here I go.....<br />

Time for Remembering            by Kiersty<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
I try so hard to remember what it fealt like in the rain<br />
refreshing drops of water, washing all the pain<br />
a heart is beating softly, the faith no longer there.<br />
changes made, or trying, a mind that's full of care.<br />
the 2 way street is closing, 1 way is creeping fast<br />
for future sees a lonely soul, happieness not to last<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Sometimes the doubt takes over, sometimes the fear is strong.<br />
Sometimes the tears flow longer, sometimes it all feels wrong.<br />
Our love is not mistaken, it's beautiful and true.<br />
My love is overflowing, all because of you.<br />
I know we're far away from us, I know it all to well.<br />
But the love we share will conquer all and only time will tell.<br />
Please never doubt my love is strong, forever in my heart.<br />
I dream of times we will be one, nevermore to part.<br />
Very soon our hearts will unite, and we'll be in total bliss.<br />
All the waiting will then cease with one tender kiss.<br />
written to my lgnd.... I love you baby!

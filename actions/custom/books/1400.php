by H. P. Lovecraft<br />
<br />
To The<br />
Gods, Heros, &amp; Ideals<br />
Of The<br />
ANCIENTS<br />
This Volume is Affectionately<br />
DEDICATED<br />
By<br />
A<br />
GREAT<br />
ADMIRER<br />
<br />
I submit to the publik these idle lines, hoping they will please.<br />
<br />
They form a sort of series, with my Odyssey, Iliad, Aeneid, and the like.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Ode to Selene or Diana</span><br />
<br />
Immortal Moon, in maiden splendour shine;<br />
 Dispense thy beams, divine Latona's child.<br />
Thy silver rays all grosser things define,<br />
 And hide harsh Truth in sweet illusion mild.<br />
<br />
In thy soft light, the city of unrest<br />
 That stands so squalid in thy brother's glare,<br />
Throws off its habit, and in silence blest,<br />
 Becomes a vision, sparkling bright and fair.<br />
<br />
The modern world, with all its care and pain<br />
 The smokey streets, the loathsome clanging mills,<br />
Face 'neath thy breams, Selene, and again<br />
 We dream as shepherds on Chaldea's hills.<br />
<br />
Take heed, Diana, of my humble plea;<br />
 Convey me where my happiness can last,<br />
Draw me against the tide of Time's rought sea,<br />
 And let my spirit rest amidst the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">To the Old Pagan Religion</span><br />
<br />
Olympian gods! how can I let ye go,<br />
 And pin my faith to this new Christian creed?<br />
Can I resign the deities I know,<br />
 for him who on a cross for man did bleed?<br />
<br />
How in my weakness can my hopes depend<br />
 On one lone god, tho' mighty be his pow'r?<br />
Why can Jove's host no more assistance lend,<br />
 To Soothe my pain, and cheer my troubled hour?<br />
<br />
Are there no dryads on these wooded mounts<br />
 O'er which I oft in desolation roam?<br />
Are there no naiads in these crystal founts<br />
 Or nereids upon the ocean foam?<br />
<br />
Fast spreads the new; the older faith declines;<br />
 The name of Christ resounds upon the air;<br />
But my wrack'd soul in solitude repines<br />
 And gives the gods their last-received pray'r.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">On the Ruin of Rome</span><br />
<br />
How dost thou lie, O Rome, neath the foot of the Teuton<br />
Slaves are they men, and bent to the will of thy conqueror;<br />
Wither hath gone, great city, the race that gave law to all nations,<br />
Subdu'd the East and the West, and made them bow down to thy consuls,<br />
Knew not defeat, but gave it to all who attack'd thee?<br />
<br />
Dead! and replac'd by these wretches who cower in confusion.<br />
Dead! they who gave us this empire to guard and to live in,<br />
Rome, thou didst fall from thy pow'r with the proud race that made thee,<br />
and we, base Italians, enjoy'd what we could not have builded.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">To Pan</span><br />
<br />
Seated in a woodland glen<br />
By a shallow stream<br />
Once I fell a-musing, when<br />
I was lull'd into a dream.<br />
<br />
From the brook a shape arose<br />
Half a man and half a goat,<br />
Hoofs it had instead of toes<br />
And a beard adorn'd its throat.<br />
<br />
On a set of rustic reeds<br />
Sweetly play'd this hybrid man<br />
Naught car'd I for earthly needs,<br />
For I knew that this was Pan.<br />
<br />
Nymphs and Satyrs gather'd round<br />
To enjoy the lively sound.<br />
<br />
All to soon I woke in pain<br />
And return'd to haunts of men<br />
But in rural vales I'd fain<br />
Live and hear Pan's pipes again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">On the Vanity of Human Ambition</span><br />
<br />
Apollo, chasing Daphen, claim'd his prize<br />
But lo! she turn'd to wood before his eyes.<br />
More modern swains at golden prizes aim,<br />
And ever strive some worldly thing to claim,<br />
Yet 'tis the same as in Apollo's case,<br />
For, once attain'd, the purest gold seems base.<br />
All that men seek's unworthy of the quest,<br />
Yet seek they will, and never pause for rest.<br />
True bliss, methinks, a man can only find<br />
In virtuous life, and cultivated mind.

<span style="font-style:italic;">Told as it should be told...by Chris.</span><br />
<br />
Since the first times of time, all were what they were, destined to always be what they were until they decided to be what they wanted to be. <br />
To dare to be what you want, rather than what you were, is a daring dare worth daring yourself to dare.<br />
<br />
Chris is what he wants to be. He is no longer what he was, for he has moved on towards bigger, better things.<br />
<br />
This is Chris, his finite form, for all forms are finite, limited, concrete. <br />
This is Chris, his infinite soul, for all souls are infinite, unconfined, unlimited.<br />
<br />
This is Chris.<br />

<br />
Perhaps the story begins, as oft times one story does, at the beginning, for all beginnings begin at the origin of beginning,<br />
the beginning begins thus from the beginning of the beginning.<br />
<br />
Free eggs. Parachute socks. Turtle riders. Falling sacks of dry meal.<br />
Santa Claus. Bruised peaches. Overreacting faces. Hot-blooded justice. Cold-cut sandwiches.<br />
All bubbling, brewing, fermenting into a lovely concoction that stimulates the mind, tickles the funny bone,<br />
intrigues the consumer, and pleases the creator all in one quaff.<br />
<br />
This is the dream.<br />
<br />
This is the result.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style:italic;">Hopes and Dreams...<br />
Always can be...<br />
Reality...</span><br />
<br />
Thus Chris draws.<br />
He draws...<br />
and draws...<br />
and draws...<br />
and draws...<br />
and draws...<br />
<br />
He draws until he will complete the perfect blend, well-aged, of course, for it has been sitting in the pools of undiscovered knowledge that rest in his mind until it is found and translated onto paper...the final draft, capable of going down smooth and being acceptable to any palate, experienced and new alike. <br />
Then, with this comic of perfect proportions finally discovered, created, and displayed, his life shall be finished, accomplished, fulfilled. <br />
<br />
One drawing, to make the world smile.<br />
One character, to make the world chuckle.<br />
One line, to make the world laugh.<br />
One comic, to make the world applaud.<br />
<br />
This is the hope.<br />
This is the dream.<br />
<br />
Until the time when this is realized, when his destiny is fulfilled, Chris draws...<br />
<br />
Until that comic...until that realization...<br />
<br />
Until that day...<br />
<br />

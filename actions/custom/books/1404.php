Hi, I am TrebleClef84 and I wanted to make a book with pictures of my pets...<br />
<br />

These are my cats. Their names are Cookie, Milche, and Lily White.<br />

This is Oreo cookie. We adopted her from the local animal shelter. She likes birds and ferrets. <br />
She also likes to go to Petsmart on the leash and play in the cat furniture playground.<br />

This is Lily White, a Turkish Angora. We adopted her from the same local animal shelter. <br />
She was pregnant and sick when we adopted her...and we lost all of her kittens. <br />
We did get to keep her though. She is very sweet and loyal.<br />

This is our Milche. She was also adopted from the local animal shelter. <br />
She is all white with blue eyes. What is special about her is that most white blue eyed cats are deaf. <br />
Milche is not. She likes to run up and lick your leg <br />
before running off again.<br />

This is Sarah the poodle. A woman that I worked with found her tied to a tree in the middle of <br />
July Florida weather. She had 9 puppies a week later- even though she only weighed 30 lbs. <br />
She is now spoiled rotten.<br />
<br />

My pride and joy is named Luigi. He is a male Eclectus parrot. He talks and flies around the apartment. <br />
His favorite activity is making a mess. We did have a female Eclectus for a couple of days (pictured below) <br />
but they didn't get along so well.<br />

In late February of 2007, Luigi broke his leg. At the time of this publishing, he had 4 more weeks left in his cast. <br />
He drove his mother crazy!!<br />

It wouldn't be very long before he was back to flying...<br />

<br />
Well that is all and I hope you enjoyed my picture book of pets. Hopefully someone will use this idea <br />
and we will see many more picture books of pets around.<br />

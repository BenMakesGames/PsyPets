&quot;Mr PotatoHead was complaing of boredom. <br />
So I have sent him out on a Vacation.<br />
I hope he gets to visit a lot of you.&quot; <img src="http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/2494/potatoecl1.png"><br />

&quot;My pets had a blast having an extra Windup Potato Head around. The smaller pets are still learning how to share. <br />
The visit was a smashing success until the youngest pets started fussing over who was next. This made Mr. Potato Head quite bored.<br />
<br />
I hope he has a good time at the next home. I'm sure he will. I've chosen someone who is quite helpful, generous, and kind.&quot;<br />
<br />

&quot;A small knock at my door revealed Mr. potato head. He decided to stop by and rest, maybe even stay for dinner........<br />
<br />
After a yummy meal, Mr. Potato Head tells me he has heard strange tales of weird science experiments coming from a Science lab down the road...he goes to explore.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Chemgeek</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potato Head has knocked on my door asking to learn about Chemistry. Off to the lab we go! Good thing I have potato-sized goggles and lab coats.<br />
<br />
What a long day we've had in the Lab! Mr. Potato helped me make several potions and even offered to clean the glassware once we were done! We had a wonderful vegetarian dinner that did not include potatoes (a cannibal he is not!) and with his potato-sized goggles and lab coat as a souvenir, he's off to see some more of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">LilMissSunshine</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potato head is resuming his adventure now after a long day of playing with the friends in the land of Sunshine. He basked in the warm glow and indulged in many sweets. We laughed and drank some tea and then shed a few tears as we wished him a fond farewell.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Booksmart</span>:<br />
&quot;Welcome to my house, Mr. PotatoHead!<br />
(I think the Albino Duck Horde makes him a little nervous, but I'm sure they'll get along fine).<br />
<br />
I think he had a lovely time here at Chez booksmart. He went out hunting with Laverne, made a Couch with Flannabelle, and even played with the newborn babies.<br />
Off he goes to continue his adventure...&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Elspet</span>:<br />
&quot;I'm sorry to say that Mr. PotatoHead's stay at my house was less than a rousing success. <br />
I was out all day at work and in class, and a particularly vicious jury of architects sent me and my classmates into such a funk that we went out for drinks afterward, leaving all of my pets and my auspicious guest to their own devices.<br />
Tuffy, Zink, and Aury made a wreck of the Common room, and Mr. PotatoHead spent the entire evening keeping Snaps and Love from burning themselves in the kitchen as they tried to cook dinner for themselves.<br />
Mr. PotatoHead was most gracious about the entire affair, but I think that he was relieved to step down the driveway and go to find his hostess for the next day. <br />
Hopefully I will not be receiving a visit from Social Services; I was still a bit tipsy when I arrived at home to see Mr. PotatoHead off, and he expressed concern for the wellbeing of my pets.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Caleby</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. PotatoHead was a bit tipsy when he showed up at my house. I wonder where he got the drinks from... But anyway, after he sobered up some, he started to enjoy himself. <br />
Well, I actually saw him opening some skate and sniffing lines. I think Mr. PotatoHead may have a drug and alcohol problem. I'm going to send him off to rehab, yet I don't know if he can stick with a 12 week program.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Nanashi-chan</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead showed up at my doorstep this morning with a bit of a hangover. I gave him some advil and he's now spacing out in front of the TV with Regina and Felix. Maybe he'll hang out with me when I get back from class tonight. <br />
<br />
Alright, I hope Mr. Potatohead had a fun time here. <br />
It's Katsucon next weekend, and I've been helping my friend prepare her cosplay outfits in our free time. <br />
Felix and Regina wanted in on the fun, so they made their own costumes. Mr. Potatohead wanted to dress up as well, but unfortunately, Felix wouldn't relinquish his Darth Vader outfit. (I heard that Mr. Potatohead got it on at one point while Felix was out, but I've yet to see proof.) Instead, Mr. Potatohead got to dress up in Regina's costume. Unfortunately, Felix managed to snap a picture. <br />
I hope his visit here hasn't scarred Mr. Potatohead for life. I'm sending him to a household next where I think he won't have to face raging fangirls.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Retrograve</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead is off to a new destination, but wanted me to let everyone know he's had a great time meeting the newborns, though he wonders why I named them so oddly. <br />
He also had a nice time chatting up season me, being a fellow food pet. Is there romance the air?&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Rika</span>:<br />
<img src="http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/3295/potatozk8.png"><br />
&quot;He has had enough tea so I sent him over to Mr. FluffyMcbuttersworth's house.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. FluffyMcbuttersworth</span>:<br />
&quot;A knock at my door interupted a staring contest between me and Nuts, so being the kind hearted caring squirrel I am, I told whoever was at the door to leave me the hell alone.<br />
The knocking continued for a few hours, but it slowed down a bit, and eventualy stopped.<br />
I was in the kitchen making tea when I heard a loud crash coming from the living room, and standing there in the middle of the room, covered in soot, was Mr. Potatohead.<br />
He seemed sorta bloated, I think he had drank too much tea or something.<br />
So I invited him to stay for a while, so far hes been a pleasent house guest.<br />
After hes rested for a while, I'll send him on his way, he seems like a very busy potato.<br />
<br />
After drinking almost all of my vodka, Mr. Potatohead rudely jumped up from the table, and ran out the door. Why is he in such a big hurry!?<br />
He said something about going to visit FaileV...hmmm...<br />
Hey, wait a minute...he took my last bottle of vodka!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">FaileV</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead showed up at my door pretty drunk with a bottle of vodka, I took that away and gave him some aspirin. <br />
After he finally got sobered up and over his hang over he was a nice guest. the pets took a bit to warm up and drop stop their writing for a bit. <br />
Dante showed him around the house but Poe popped out and scared him so we had a bit of a search. Doyle found him under the bed and Lee, Potter and Keats played with him while shakespeare put on a show with the others. <br />
after the show Mr Potatohead went off to visit musti.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Musti</span>:<br />
&quot;Oh dear. I'm afraid I wasn't exactly home when Mr. Potatohead first showed up, which led to dear Pandora doing exactly what she's been instructed to do with each and every potato she comes across - locking it into the cellar to later be turned into vodka. <br />
<br />
It was hours before I learned of the mistake, but Mr. Potatohead didn't seem to mind. It's going to take a while to replenish my stores of booze, though, and he was so positively pickled for the rest of the day that all he wanted to do was lie around and declare 'I love you man' to any baffled pet that happened to wander by.<br />
<br />
.....I may or may not have convinced him to try french fries at some point for sheer amusement value. &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
In any case, I was glad to kick the lush out at the end of the day. Prepare yourself, Saber. That's going to be one hell of a hangover.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Saberclaw</span>:<br />
&quot;Potatohead? Little terror, he is. Nearly cost us a full day of work!<br />
Came home, found a creature rummaging through my birthday booze in the sorting room. How he managed to avoid my heel is beyond me. Managed to corner him in the greenhouse, and someone finally bothered to tell me Musti had sent him. Hmph. I guess a day isn't too long. Not as if he can destroy everything that quickly.<br />
Lucky me, Ketna and Baron discovered he's quiet when drunk. Too bad he went through all the booze in the first three hours. At least he's pretty handy around the workshop when hungover. He managed to help us make our quota for building supplies. We couldn't have gotten everything installed without his help. <br />
Too bad Kaade told him as much. He spent the rest of the day turning the wine to vinegar, breaking the taffy maker, burning the food for tomorrow, and scaring away all the fish. I hope none of the pets decide to keep following his teachings. Making me rust before my time...<br />
When he hit upon the fantastic idea of telling the gatherers to smash rocks open with their tools for the wonderful prizes inside, I gave him the boot. Good thing I missed. I'd hate to scrape Mr. MashedPotatohead off the driveway. Hope you enjoy him, KS.<br />
...<br />
God damn it, where's all the skate?&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">KS</span>:<br />
&quot;Good thing for Mr Potatohead, he arrived while I was home. Lawlz had taken a liking to flying around, bashing things in with his guitar... I do hate mashed potatoes. After reminding the little shits that he was a guest (and therefore were not allowed to use him as defeating/hunting practice ), things went smoothly. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the babies had to wake up some time...<br />
Not realizing that potatoes with body parts != food, they attempted to peck at and eat him. That adventure ended with Mr Potatohead fending them off, using one of his arms as a sword. ...Perhaps I should leave more jerky in the house. <br />
<br />
Maybe he'll avoid being dinner easier at Alisa's...&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Alisa</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead was lucky I got fair warning he was coming... I had just enough time to make Achilles promise he wouldn't bake him. While Mr. Potatohead was over, he did have to deal with a couple births, though. That... wasn't fun. After he got nauseous, Evangelina crafted him a nice (purple) pillow to rest on, and the newborn sooty came over and rested with him.<br />
<br />
After all that, Mr. Potatohead was happy to get sent off to Blackstar, though he does like the cuddly newborn.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Blackstar</span>:<br />
&quot;Oh boy, I feel sorry for Mr. Potatohead. Not only did he have to run around trying to avoid the Vanillabo's, for they thought he was food, but he nearly got stomped on my Adronoth as well. He spent some time hiding in my pile of Shimoku Plushies, so really, they ARE good for something, at least. <br />
<br />
I should also mention I had to fish him out of Farsight's stomach, he mistook Mr. Potatohead for food, so he might be a little soggy for a while. Not to mention missing a few bits from the beaks that did get him.<br />
<br />
So hopefully he doesnt drag digestive juices all over the place while he's at Presto's, I dont think that acid will do his furniture any good.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Grace C</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr Potato Head had a nice day with me. He would have had fun playing with all of my pets, but unfortunately I retro'ed. <br />
Out of boredom, he decided to head off to wotme's house and see if he might actually do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Wotme</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr Potato Head turned up at wotme's house to find no-one in but luckily wotme had left a note saying they were all at the recycling plant so he headed off to meet them.<br />
<br />
wotme was stuffing stuff into the recycling machine that the pets were passing to her ( bare in mind the annoying newborns were passing her rocks constantly so she wasn't really paying much attention to what she was stuffing in there as she was too busy chucking the rocks back at them) <br />
<br />
Fexar noticed Mr Potato Head's arrival so he went over to eat greet him when Mr Potato Head started babbling about how people had got him drunk, he had been taken back in time, stomped on and generally mistreated by everyone's pets, five minutes later fexar got bored picked up the annoying Mr Potato Head and wandered over to wotme who promptly grabbed Mr Potato Head and shoved him down the machine's mouth. <br />
Screams and wails erupted from every pets mouth as wotme reached for the lever to recycle Mr Potato Head, so she looked down the tube hoping fearing she'd stuck one of the newborns down there to find poor Mr Potato Head clinging desperately to the side. wotme smirked at him and promptly pulled him out. <br />
Mr Potato Head put his arm back on that wotme had pulled off rescuing him and then gave fexar a dirty look. <br />
wotme then barked out orders to all of the pets and gathered up the newborns and headed off home, Mr Potato Head decided to follow them. When they all arrived back at wotme's she ordered them all to put away the materials so she could make Mr Potato Head a cup of tea, Mr Potato Head settled down to drink his tea while organized chaos went off in the house blissfully unaware he was being watched. All of a sudden Miss Potato Head erupted into the room (who has a cross dressing fetish) grabbed Mr Potato Head and dragged him off to the whippery and locked the door. There were screams echoing round the house for hours but none of the pets seemed to be bothered by this. After a while it went quiet and Mr Potato Head emerged from the room quite disheveled and lightly bleeding but he was grinning from ear to ear. <br />
<br />
wotme gave him first aid treatment for his cuts and bruises and then disappeared into the whippery were the screaming started again. She emerged 5mins later with a cut on her head and promptly told Mr Potato Head to get the hell out while he could and for him to go visit Tomi NOW! RUN! as Miss Potato Head emerged from the whippery and advanced towards him.<br />
Mr Potato Head ran for the door and slammed it shut just in time, the last thing he saw was wotme and 45 pets trying to hide behind the sofa.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Tomi</span>:<br />
&quot;in the wee early in the morning i heard this *knock, knock, knock* at my door. i open the door to find this batterly beaten potato looking for some booze and food.<br />
i told the potato &quot;i don't have booze here but i can get you some food, come on in&quot;<br />
all the pets have awaken to find this potato sitting on our couch sipping some mint tea and cookies i have offered.<br />
masikaluv asks &quot;who is this potato you let in and can we trust him?&quot; I replied &quot; he is just a lone wandering soul just looking for a bite to eat. <br />
Mr. Potatohead replies &quot;I am not a lone wandering soul, i just decided to backpack around the world and ended up at up at some places that weren't so nice to me&quot;<br />
&quot;Calm, calm Mr. Potato, mi casa su casa&quot; I replied. &quot;I have to get to work all so pets make sure you watch him and I will be home in a few&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead said &quot;I must leave now and thank your mistress for her generosity since I won't be here when she returns. I heard that there is this very nice woman I must meet named Psfarrow. Ta for now!!!!&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Psfarrow</span>:<br />
&quot;There was a knock on the door, and the general staff go-fer answered it. I'm sorry, she said, but all of the pets are either sleeping or not receiving company. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm coming in, old lady; don't try to stop me. The missus (Mrs. Potato, etc.) has been nagging me long distance with e-mail. She's demanding I come home at once and tend to business at home. I need a place to use my laptop to get things straightened out.&quot;<br />
Come in, said staff. You may wait in the salon. I'll notify Thena, the boss cat.<br />
<br />
Note from staff:<br />
Thena was having a bad hair day. Mr. PotatoHead was thrown out on his ear and the laptop went sailing. The laptop is fine, but Mr. P has a chunk missing (chips anyone?). I did hear him say he was going to visit his friend gerty4 - one of the few females around that knew a good potato when they saw one.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Gerty4</span>:<br />
&quot;I logged in this morning to find Mr PotatoHead at my house. Crossly, he let me know that he had been standing out side my door for 7 hours! I let him in, gave him some food, and he fell asleep on my couch at once. <br />
After he woke, PotatoHead found that his hidden supply of wine was gone! I, in the meantime, was delighted to see that my pets were not depressed any more! But they were rather sleepy... Then I heard PotatoHead mutter something about going to see if Brooke Marie had any wine left.&quot;<br />
<br />
{B}Brooke Marie</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potato Head was knocking on my door, luckily, he wasent standing in the cold, freezing ice too long..<br />
*YOU DONT WANT HIM TO BE FROZEN!*<br />
<br />
He asked me something about wine, and I said, umm, are you a alcoholic? If so, first I gotta check if you're drunk, before I give you more...<br />
Mr. Potato head wasen't drunk, so I fed him 15 wines, whew, he wanted whiskey, but yeah..<br />
Mr. Potato Head fell asleep and farted, so I decided to go and pick who to send him to next.<br />
<br />
I decided to take him to AndAliceSays to see what she can do elsewhere for the farting potato.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">AndAliceSays</span>:<br />
&quot;Wow. i must've been at lectures when Mr PotatoHead turned up at my house, which is probably a good thing if he was as flatulant as Brooke says. Halcyon's been filling me in on his activities while i was away, though, and she did mention a rather unwelcome smell accompanying the more welcome potato.<br />
<br />
Mr Potatohead must've been slightly abashed at his behaviour on his vacation so far, because he's been good as gold at mine. When i finally got back from lectures i found a whole new room (named Dy Nin' Rhm in my style, whether satyrical or not i'm not sure...) positively filled with homemade goodies. i noticed a couple of redsberry wines had gone unaccountably missing in the cooking process, but since he'd fed and kept happy all my pets, restoring the ones that had just birthed to a happy state as soon as their trauma was over, i'm not too bothered.<br />
<br />
There was plenty of stuff left over, so Mr Potatohead's decided to stay another day and host a giveaway in Commerce, before moving on on his travels.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Nimbus</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr PotatoHead is now staying with us! <br />
He's been working really hard on building a greenhouse, and has had some wine... Let's hope he sticks the nails in straight!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Starrification</span>:<br />
&quot;After arriving at Starr's house, the two were wondering what they would do...<br />
A night out on the town seemed like the best idea, but they had no money...<br />
They decided to hang out at a gasstation, where they quickly met Gary and Steve who had a get rich quick scheme and asked the 2 broke pets to join in.<br />
What went down next is a little blurry but only this picture reveals what went down at the gasstation<br />
<br />
So, after killing Gary &amp; Steve and taking theyre cuts too, they decided it was now time to go out on the town.<br />
They reached a virtually abandoned bar at the beach, and saw these 4 hot girls mixing up drinks and decided to have a go for it.<br />
About 10 drinks each later and alot of attempts at flirting and not scoring, they decided the chicks must have been lesbians and decided to move on to a stripclub !<br />
The girls here were alot nicer after being tipped, they had a blast and got ever more wasted ! When the stripclub closed, 4 girls went along with them and they went for a walk in the park. The following actions can only be guessed from viewing the picture.<br />
they woke up with huge headaches, a bunch of very nice but trashed girls, 2 phonenumbers each and enough money for Starr to go back home and mr.potatohead to move on to his next location !<br />
<br />
I wonder where he will end up next ?&quot;<br />

&quot;I am making this post of my own free will <span style="color:gray">pleasedon'tkillmepleasedon'tkillme</span>. Mr. Potatohead wants to inform the police that the hostages are alive <span style="color:gray">mommyIdon'twanttodie</span>. He requires a helicopter and one million dollars in small, unmarked bills <span style="color:red">BANG</span> <span style="color:gray">ohgodUsagi!Somebodystopthebleedingplease!</span> before he will release the hostages. Yikatta must bring the money alone, and send a mail to this address to confirm the switch. I am making this post of my own free . . . FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SAVE US!!!! <span style="color:red">BANG BANG</span>&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Yikatta</span>:<br />
&quot;I sent the money by helicopter with one of my agents, release the hostages at once! They better all be in one piece.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Dominique</span>:<br />
&quot;We're recovering quite well after our ordeal. Usagi didn't lose her leg, although things were iffy for a bit. Yikatta is going to regret paying our ransom, but I couldn't send her a warning in time. I do hope she's all right . . .&quot;<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. FluffyMcbuttersworth</span>:<br />
&quot;I believe Mr. Potatohead has been taken by the F.B.I. for questioning on his part in several murders in the tri-county area.<br />
I also believe that in being taken, Mr. Potatohead escaped from the truck which they were transporting him in, and was hiding in the woods for several days, eating nothing but mushrooms and odd crescent shaped rocks.<br />
On his fourth day in the woods, the F.B.I. caught up with him and took him back to headquarters for questioning. But, they couldnt get any information since he had removed his mouth and stuck it into his back panel.<br />
Having been no help, the F.B.I. had no choice but to release him, after clearing his mind of course.<br />
They dropped him off somewhere in the nevada desert, where he made his way to las vegas. On arriving at the strip, he stumbled into the first casino he saw and spent all the money he had on himself.<br />
Now with no money, and no where to go, Mr. Potatohead is somewhere in las vegas...cold, hungry, and alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Chipoltina</span>:<br />
&quot;Poor Mr. PotatoHead has been given a much needed rest! He has spent some time in the Plush room <br />
And now he's ready for the rest of his trip!!<br />
(I wouldn't advise keeping him near your plushies... my Wocket and Wereplushy have considerably less fluff and they now have rather shocked expressions...)&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Lynea</span>:<br />
&quot;I found Mr. Potatohead lounging smugly on my doorstep, smoking a cigar. <br />
He had the audacity to WINK at me and then ambled past me to the couch. After promptly propping his feet on the coffee table, he leered lustfully at my plushies and turned on the TV. Right now he's started watching all episodes of Battlestar Galactica so he'll be all caught up when the last season starts in April. <br />
Reading past posts of his previous adventures, I'll just lock up the plushies and hide the rum. I'll let you know how the rest of his day goes!<br />
<br />
I had to leave the house for several hours. When I returned I found such a different Mr. PotatoHead it was hard to believe it was the same one! I was able to piece together that some time after I had left, the doorbell rang. He answered the door and was greeted by two friendly people who asked him if he knew about the Kingdom of Heaven. He replied that &quot;no, he hadn't&quot; and before he knew what had happened, they were inside, sitting on the couch with him telling him all about it. I believe he even made them some sweet firespice tea &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how long they were there but by the time they left, he had a new mission in life. All he could talk about was &quot;spreading the word&quot; and &quot;renewing his life&quot;. I helped him pack up his PotatoBag and got him a bus ticket to visit SumnerRain.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">SumnerRain</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr PotatoHead came to my house because he heard my poor little pets were drowning in junk and offered to help them clean their messy home. Much in HGTV style he cracked the leather whip and forced my poor little pets to organize all their belongings into &quot;keep&quot;, &quot;sell&quot;, and &quot;donate&quot; piles. It was very hard work, but in the end the extra monies gained in yard sale profits were able to go far in the redecorating department. <br />
Now that my house is spic and span, Mr. PotatoHead has begun browsing through discarded travel brochures looking where to go next. If you have any suggestions on exotic locations and have a spare room on where to host this little guy, let me know and I will send him your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Carisio</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead has been given back to Chemgeek today so she can pass him on to someone else. <br />
My pets will miss him, but Carcin kept chasing him around, trying to inject him with benzene. I had to get him out of the house for the safety of all pets who will play with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Amum</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead has arrived! Simone is thrilled to have such a fascinating invention to play with, and Shelly has promised to take him for a flight a little later. Sheldon is trying to be cool and pretending he's not that interested. Maybe Mr. Potatohead will feel up to a duel later. <br />
<br />
Well, Shelly's taken Mr. Potatohead out for a ride, and she's dropped him off to see whasit. Everyone enjoyed his visit!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Whasit</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead came knocking politely at the door - maybe he's a little tired from all his other adventures. Right now he's settling in, trying on some feather boas, settling into the Couch cushions. I think later the pets have some Dance Mania planned, and maybe a Strategy Game.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">That Guy Ben</span>:<br />
&quot;He opened his eyes to darkness. Though he couldn't see anything, he was aware that many things were cluttered around him. After a moment of adjusting to this new situation, he figured he should at least try to figure out where he was, and stood up, bumping his head on a suit of Antique Armor. Taking a step, he nearly tripped on a Windup Gator. He finally found a wall and began to follow it. He stepped on the edge of a Bear Trap, but fortunately it didn't go off.<br />
<br />
Finally he saw a sliver of light. It was pouring in through a window, through which he saw the stars and the new moon. He climbed on a nearby pile of Mushrooms, getting himself just high enough to reach the sill, and hoisted himself up. Fortunately, the window was unlocked. He was free!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Misty21</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead came knocking at the door in search of new friends. While here he made 60 new friends and learned what it's like to have a big annoying family. Since Mr. Potatohead had to share a room, he also learned what its like to get spoiled with wines and cocktails and in the end we handed him some wine and sent him too... Lyonene!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Lyonene</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr Potatohead stopped by my house for a day or too. Then he decided he wanted to visit gerty4 for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Gerty4</span>:<br />
&quot;When I logged on this morning I found him sitting in my incoming drinking the 3 pages of wine I once had. Hoping that my pets could keep him out of trouble, I put him in my common, unaware of wine that I was about to feed to my pets was sitting right next to him. <br />
Checking back a half hour later to pet my pets, I discovered a drunken potato. I was fed up. I needed more wine! So harvested the aging roots in my greenhouse and put it in my barrel. Wondering where my redsberries had gone to, I looked around my house muttering, 'where could it be...' The potato head thought I was talking about him, so he ran away as fast as he could, with me calling after him. 'Wait, don't go yet! I am making vodka!' (meaning that I was willing to give him some) But sadly, he never came back.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps he ran to Celeste's house. Watch your supply of wine!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Celeste3</span>:<br />
&quot;When I arrived at my house toady, he had indeed come for a visit. I found him passed out on the doorstep, and Granella and Cinnamon peering through the kitchen window. Apparently they had been afraid of the 'raving drunk, who had been hammering on the door since three in the morning', and so had locked all the doors and waited in the kitchen until I got back home.<br />
Having heard of his drunken rampages before, I called Laurelie and The Fluff, and together the five of us went around the house collecting all the booze and making sure it was under lock and key. At about one o'clock, Granella went out to dump a bucket of water on him, and we brought him inside. <br />
Although very sluggish for the rest of the day, he was very charming indeed - and my pets (who had now become less cautious of him) begged for me to let him stay for dinner. Afterwards he even did the washing up, and then went straight to bed with a copy of The Many Uses of Aging Root (which I admit made me suspicious, but I let it slide). <br />
The next day he thanked me for my hospitality, but said he really must be going, as he was off to see Midnight Star...&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Midnight Star</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead came to my door several days ago and much to his dismay he learned we were in the middle of moving. <br />
Not that he minded that we were moving to a nicer place, but now he had to help and we only had pizza and no booze. <br />
After a little while he started to have fun and he was able to drive the moving truck once till he stated pushing people <br />
off the freeway while flashing the lights and honking the horn.<br />
<br />
Now that we are all settled in Mr. Potatohead is ready to go and visit Kriet &quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Kriet</span>:<br />
&quot;Mr. Potatohead, the infamous boozer that he is, showed up at the door to my dorm room earlier. To his great dismay, I'm not allowed to have any booze here, so I decided to show him to the computer so he could visit all my pets in the magical land of Psypettia.<br />
<br />
I can't carry him around campus and keep my hoard of pets happy, so he's been sent to meet all the boys and girls of Casa Kriet. Hopefully none of them eat him, or see him as a challenge, the gods know Nash, Duke and Levi are already having enough lovers' spats as it is.<br />
<br />
I had to run around in classes today, but the kids seem to have taken good care of him. He roamed around the island for a bit, always in the care of one of the Kriet family army, and managed to help my pets pull off the completion of the Apiary. <br />
Completely exhausted, we gave him one of the only wines in the house, which one of the multitude must have hunted off of a frog or something, and then we pushed him back inside to watch the Planetarium Projector with us. <br />
I left him to run around with a few of the house's adventurers while the inventors helped me with my Physics homework, and the crafters tried to distract me with shiny webcomics and writing. <br />
Mr. Potatohead wandered in at one point and ended up strapped to a wheel so my pets could demonstrate a few of the laws of physics. Needless to say, this didn't agree with Mr. Potatohead's inebriated state (methinks he found the vodka stashed in one of the protected rooms somehow) and we ended up needing to take care of him.<br />
If I didn't know any better, I'd say we cured him of his alcoholism (or at least given him a fear of rotating carnival rides). With my homework done, Mr. Potatohead cured, some alcohol ingested, and several house projects done, Mr. Potatohead decided it was time to move on. Unfortunately, he has no idea where to go. <br />
I've temporarily given him his own room, but he's decided not to come out until he has someone new to go to. He mumbled something about my physics homework before shutting the door though.<br />

&quot;Cornelienne, ex-defeater with aspirations to gather great hoardes of small and worthless food items, was digging through the latest pile of junk that had fallen in through the rubbish chute...err...post box, rather, of Ramoth's and Darrgon's castle. Much to her surprise, something was moving under the piles of white cloth that had come in from the latest recycling trip! Swiftly, silently, she pounced on it...and soon the mechanical curiosity was between her jaws - a Windup Potatohead.<br />
<br />
&quot;How dull,&quot; thought Cornelienne, &quot;Another of Mother's toys has gotten loose.&quot; She dragged it into the house and deposited it on the workbench for Ramoth to &quot;fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead was perplexed. One minute he was like the star of the Charmin commercials, swimming through mounds of fluffy white cloth; the next, he was partially chewed and left alone on a cold, metallic table surrounded by bits of junk.<br />
<br />
He gasped in horror - there, merely inches away from him, lay the remains of his cousin Sally, who had lost her arms and mouth in the Great Chewtoy Incident of '02!<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop messing with the junk on the workbench, Cor!&quot; The deafening roar shook Mr. Potatohead from his trauma-induced reverie.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your experiment got away, mum!&quot; came the shrieked reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one is it now?&quot; The voice was less harsh now, though it was closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;This Potatohead was out amid the recycling trash!&quot; With that, Mr. Potatohead was violently snatched from the table and shaken a bit in the baby dragon's claw.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I might be ill,&quot; Mr. Potatohead said to himself as he was jostled around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but that one's not mine, Dear,&quot; Ramoth replied gently. She took Mr. Potatohead from her daughter and carefully turned him over, inspecting the artist's signature through a pair of laser goggles, &quot;Look here; he was made by MoleBunny and he's got a crafter's mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, but then what was he doing amid the recycling?&quot; wondered Cornelienne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem!&quot; Mr. Potatohead cleared his throat, &quot;I'll have you know that my name is Mr. Potatohead and I'm a Grade A Drinking...uh...Thinking Toy! I was made from the finest home-grown potato and the best bits this side of Psypettia! And Cousin Sally over there - I demand that she be repaired at once!&quot; He pointed feebly from where he hung, upside-down, in Ramoth's paw.<br />
<br />
Ramoth and Cornelienne both chuckled. &quot;I think you're a bit confused, Sir Potato. This Windup Potatohead isn't finished yet because I haven't been able to find parts for it for nearly a year,&quot; Ramoth explained, &quot;The arms are only available on Halloween, and the mouth, well, I'm lucky to find those in the daily debris once in a blue moon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; shouted Mr. Potatohead, who was having a bit of a nervous breakdown, &quot;I must've wandered into a bad dream!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ramoth and Cornelienne exchanged a glance and shrugged. &quot;Oh well, I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Why don't you take him to the Game Room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Potatohead sobbed and whined the entire way, nestled rather uncomfortably between several of the sharpest teeth belonging to the baby dragon. He was deposited in a chest with several other toys, including a confused looking windup woof, which greeted him with: &quot;Woof? Woofy Woof?&quot; It then nuzzled him.<br />
<br />
&quot;GAH! LET ME OUTTA HERE!&quot; screamed Mr. Potatohead hysterically.<br />
&quot;Woofy Woof!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you'd better send him on his way,&quot; suggested Komeryu, who was in the middle of a light saber battle with his brother Ferkoth, &quot;I don't think he likes it here much, and he's going to mess up my concentration if he keeps it up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, off you go!&quot; Cornelienne exclaimed. She grabbed Mr. Potatohead and the Woof, which had attached itself to his wrist and wouldn't let go, and put them in the next post box set to leave the castle.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">SilverStar</span>:<br />
&quot;Ok, the book is going to be started!<br />
Once the story gets a bit boring/long we will make up an ending <br />
<br />
I came home to find all my pets sobbing in the corner, more emo then they were when they had made the serious error of listening to an album of Fall Out Boy. Catbait was even more nervous than usuall. Desperate to find the solution I went to the lounge room, the kitchen and the protected room. <br />
Unable to find any cause to the pets depression I went to the basement to make some wine for my depressed pets. I found two strange objects banging on the door whining &quot;Me wantie wiinnneee!'<br />
<br />
I took the screaming thing to the lounge room where I discoverd it was a potato, a freak of nature. I thought of making it into some vodka to fix my sad pets but the windup woof attached to its arm obviously would give it a bad taste.<br />
<br />
Whats the matter? I asked it, almost afraid of the answer I was going to get<br />
My mother never loved me he wined My father left me when I was a little spud. I dropped out of highschool to get a job! he continued to sob T-then if thats not bad enough he sniffed I get passed around by cruel people like some parcel, I get attacked by huge monsters weilding light sabers, I nearly get killed while the disembowled body of my cousin lies on a bench!<br />
<br />
I sat stunned, this potato had some serious drinking and mental issues so im sending him to Chemgeek for some &quot;councilling&quot; or at least to get him out of my hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Chemgeek</span>:<br />
&quot;Mister Potatohead ended up on my doorstep this morning a little lost. It seems he was in such a hurry to head to Traveller's house that he forgot to pack a map and ended up quite off course. I fed him a nice breakfast and not only gave him directions but handed him a map when I sent him on his way to The Traveller's house.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">The Traveller</span>:<br />
&quot;As soon as Mr. Potatohead entered my house, Diva let out her trademark high-pitched scream... 'eeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!', jumped on him and dragged him up in the attic. Not just me but all the other pets in the house were left behind with open mouths and raised eyebrows.<br />
<br />
You need to know Diva is the leader of The Traveller's house. She has her personal guards, she throws a big fit whenever something is not &quot;right&quot; and I am actually not her owner but her slave as she forces me to make her fresh Tom Kah Gai every day -- she refuses to eat anything else and you know how women get if... but that's another story.<br />
<br />
I tiptoed upstairs to see what they were doing in the attic and overheard snippets of their conversation, interrupted by weird slurping sounds. Not exactly sure what they were doing but apparently they were pen pals for quite a while already and Diva kept addressing him with 'Potty'. <br />
<br />
'Potty keep scratching my neck, you are so good at it&quot;<br />
&quot;Can't we get off that hard chest my dear&quot;<br />
&quot;Uiiiiiii&quot;<br />
&quot;You are so much nicer than this ugly purple hag&quot;<br />
&quot;Uiiii thank you Potty... er, what hag?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ramoth&quot;<br />
&quot;Eww, I hate her, keep scratching Potty&quot;<br />
<br />
This went on for hours like that and when they finally came down to the common room again, Diva looked a bit disoriented but at peace with the world... and Mr. Potatohead was trying to tidy up his peel as if the others wouldn't have noticed anyway.<br />
<br />
The guards definitely enjoyed their day off. <br />
<br />
Diva charmed a 'come back soon, my dear' into Mr. Potatohead's ear as he left the house to meet up with Rhiannon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Rhiannon</span>:<br />
&quot;bump<br />
<br />
Harper looked up from the worktable where she was piecing together her latest invention.<br />
<br />
bump<br />
<br />
She put down her left-handed spanner wrench and walked towards the front of the house, the source of the sound.<br />
<br />
BUMP<br />
<br />
A bit irritated, she opened the door a little too quickly and jumped back as a potatohead -- looking somewhat the worse for wear -- and a windup woof toppled inside.<br />
<br />
Rostaing came over from her own worktable, trailing wires and bits of cellophane. &quot;What in the world is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; said Harper. &quot;But it sure looks ... um ... content.&quot; She laughed at the potato lying motionless on the floor. &quot;I didn't think tubers could smile like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rostaing petted the windup woof. &quot;Well then, I guess he can lie there for a bit until he's ready to move on. But what if Stiles or one of the others comes home and steps on him there? I don't think mashed potatoes on the house menu for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harper walked back to her bench, fiddled for a bit, and returned with a piece of poster board decorated with flashing icicle lights and newly painted with the words: WARNING! POTTED POTATO. &quot;That should keep him safe until ctofine can come by and pick him up. She's good with ... um ... foodstuffs, or so I hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of food, let's find something for the woof to eat,&quot; said Rostaing. &quot;DO they eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea ...&quot; said Harper again.&quot;

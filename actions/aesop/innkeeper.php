<p style="text-indent:16px;">A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning.  When he had waited some days in vain, he saw the Innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before his door.</p>
<p style="text-indent:16px;">The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him.  As the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent:16px;">The Innkeeper said, "Why do you howl so fearfully?"</p>
<p style="text-indent:16px;">"I will tell you," said the Thief, "but first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces.  I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes, or for any other cause; but this I do know, that when I yawn for the third time, I actually turn into a wolf and attack men."  With this speech he commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first.</p>
<p style="text-indent:16px;">The Innkeeper, hearing his tale and believing what he said, became greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away.</p>
<p style="text-indent:16px;">The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop, saying, "Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces in my fury, when I turn into a wolf."  At the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl.</p>
<p style="text-indent:16px;">The Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left his new coat in the Thief's hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn for safety.</p>
<p style="text-indent:16px;">The Thief made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn.</p>

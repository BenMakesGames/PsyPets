<br>
Finally!  We're out of the Lenese Tenashu woods!  The foothills of the Ta Gilovan Ridge is not far off, and we hope to arrive by nightfall.<br>

<b>November 4th</b><br>
<br>
There was a brief skirmish last night.  A couple stray Robots in Disguise jumped us before we could recognize them.  At first we were worried that they were some of Shumesaka's minions, but they don't seem to have any connection - if anything they remi<br>
<br>
I don't remember what I was writing earlier today.  A couple men - Vehila, and I believe it was Dule - alerted me to what appeared to be the remains of a Ghost in a Blanket, and I went to investigate immediately.  Night is falling now, and the men are all on the edge.  We're keeping double shifts in case any more of the things show up, or worse, posessed urns.<br>

<b>November 6th</b><br>
<br>
After some trouble crossing a river, we're finally making our way up the Ta Gilovan Ridge.  We met up with Mapaso's group, and he reports that Dyvawu, Nonona Kife and others are on their way as well.  Everyone seems to be right on time.  Surely Shumesaka has noticed the advances by now; we're nearly upon his castle.  I don't think it will be long before the fight.<br>
<br>
<b>November 7th</b><br>
<br>
I talked to Nonona Kife today.  His spies have reported an uncanny stillness within Shumesaka's castle.  Fearing a trap, we're to hold back for now.<br>

<b>November 10th</b><br>
<br>
Nonona Kife and I have formed a single group, and are going to investiage Shumesaka's castle more thoroughly.  We're just finishing preparations - I had to sneak in this entry while Nonona Kife wasn't looking.  He wants us to make as efficient time as possible.<br>
<br>
It must be almost midnight.  We barely escaped some of the castle's traps with our lives.  So far there have been no deaths - it seems many of the traps have been set off by wandering Gelatinous Cubes - however Saba's leg did get badly burned by some kind of wall trap.<br>
<br>
The castle, other than a few roaming monsters, appears to be completely empty, however.  Nonona Kife is extremely suspicious: either the enemy is well hidden, he says, or we have been tricked into wasting our time by coming here.<br>
<br>
<b>November 11th</b><br>
<br>
I'm about to go back to sleep, but this is surprising news.  Ta Gilova sends word that they were attacked not only by Shumesaka's legion of zombies, but by Shumesaka himself.  This apparently took place five days ago at noon, probably at about the same time we were busy defeating an inconveniently-placed river.  Shumesaka apparently went down quickly.  Suspicious at first, spiritualists have confirmed that it is indeed Shumsaka's body, and it seems like tomorrow - well, when I wake up again - we're to search the castle for anything left behind that may give further insight into Shumesaka's plans before his death.<br>
<br>
I'm about to rouse the rest of the men.  Nonona Kife is already sending in some people to take their time disarming traps, since we no longer need fear the appearance of any of Shumesaka's legion.<br>
<br>
It's almost noon now, and we think we've found Shumesaka's main study.  It'll be a while to get all the traps out of the way.<br>
<br>
<b>November 12th</b><br>
<br>
Yesterday night one of Nonona Kife's - I think he said the name was Dylamy - had some difficulty removing one of the traps... a gasseous cloud killed several men, Dylamy included, and not moments later they rose again, mindless, to strike at us.  It was difficult at first, but they were struck down again, and burned.  They will never rise again; they should have never rose once.<br>
<br>
We found a few interesting pieces of jewerly, one of which is some kind of gem-encrusted piece worn on a necklace that we found under what is presumably Shumesaka's bed.  Nonona Kife is particularly interested, and has set one of his spiritualists to look in to it.  Though the rest of the this study has been rendered safe, we're not comfortable about resting here after the battle last night, so I think we'll be back out in the hallways again.<br>
<br>
<b>November 13th</b><br>
<br>
Mila Be Jevafeni, the spiritualist whose name I couldn't remember - no surprise why - has determined the purpose behind what is now being called Shumesaka's Folly.  It is apparently a device to ensure that the wearer never dies, no matter how useless their body may become.  Apparently, though Shumesaka had many zombies of his own, he would not resign himself to undeath.  Anyway, it appears as if he simply left it here - forgotten? - and headed out to battle.  It's no wonder he was defeated so quickly.   Mila Be Jevafeni has therefore chosen the name "Shumesaka's Folly," and it has stuck well.  So well that Vehila wouldn't keep quiet about it until hours later.<br>
<br>
Nonona Kife is this very moment writing a message to be carried back to Ta Gilova.  This will probably, thankfully, be our last day here.  A larger and more complete investigation will begin later, I'm sure, by a properly equipped team.  For a preliminary search, however, Nonona Kife agrees that we have made some unexpectedly useful discoveries.

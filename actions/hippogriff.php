<b>The Hippogriff</b></p>
<p><i>by Arnold Sundgaard</i></p>
<p>
When Mare and Griffin meet and mate<br />
Their offspring share a curious fate.<br />
One half is Horse with hooves and tail,<br />
The rest is Eagle, claws and nail.<br />
As a Horse it likes to graze<br />
In summer meadows doused in haze,<br />
Yet as an Eagle it can fly<br />
Above the clouds where dreams drift by.<br />
With such a Beast I am enthralled,<br />
The Hippogriff this beast is called.<br />

<p>HERG RESEARCH LABS - Numerous sightings of strange fish with rabbit ears were reported midnight last night.  Witnesses saw them running in packs to the coast and into the ocean.  No one knows where these creatures came from, or where they're going, but Darren Heckart, the HERG team's expert ecologist, has some ideas.</p>
<p>"Many of the animals we've found in the Hollow Earth exhibit migratory behavior despite there being very little in the way of seasons there," Darren explains.</p>
<p>Unlike the surface, which experiences seasons due to its tilt and path around the sun, the Hollow Earth maintains the same climate at all times of the year.</p>
<p>"If they're not migrating due to climate changes, then why <em>are</em> they migrating?  It's no accident that yesterday was Easter - in fact last year we noticed a large migration of Hollow Earth creatures on Easter day - but what about this day could possibly trigger a migration?  It's an especially difficult question since Easter this year was much earlier than Easter last year."</p>
<p>Eve Heidel, the lead scientist at HERG, has even more questions.</p>
<p>"Where did these rabbit-fish - or fish-rabbits - come from?  We've certainly never seen an animal like this one before inside the Hollow Earth.  Or anywhere else."</p>

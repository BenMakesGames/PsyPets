This is the story of Gaesikusaka, the first daughter of Rizi Vizi.  Her freedom is our freedom; her capture is our capture.</p>
<p>When The All was new, the last of The Three to fall out of The Darkness was Rizi Vizi.  As the last, Rizi Vizi became responsible for the endings of things.  When a log is burned, or food is let spoil; when a memory is forgotten, or a person dies; all of these things are passed to Rizi Vizi.</p>
<p>From the first dying things, Rizi Vizi created two children - a daughter, Gaesikusaka, "Death Eater", and a son, Kakibaesa-Dae, "Son of Darkness" - and charged them with the keeping of all lost and perished things.  Half were for Kakibaesa-Dae, and the other half for Gaesikusaka.</p>
<p>Gaesikusaka had a ravenous hunger, and devoured everything she received.  That which she devoured was forever lost from the memory of The All; its likeness would never be seen again.</p>
<p>Kakibaesa-Dae, on the other hand, collected and named each thing he received, carrying with him his favorite.</p>
<p>It was in this way that Kakibaesa-Dae, who was the younger, forever lost many of his favorite things, for Gaesikusaka would overpower him, take them, and devour them.  Every time this happened, Kakibaesa-Dae would lose his temper, or his wits, which would in turn also be devoured by Gaesikusaka, until one day the only thing left for him to lose was his reason, and though he fought desperately to keep it, in the end it, too, was devoured.</p>
<p>And so, Kakibaesa-Dae, once calm, became a savage monster, for the only things Gaesikusaka could not devour was his anger and grief.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #666;">- = - = - = -</p>
<p>As the two grew older, Kakibaesa-Dae, being the boy, grew stronger, until Gaesikusaka could no longer overpower him.</p>
<p>At first they were equally matched; their fights became long, and increasingly violent - Gaesikusaka even devoured one of Kakibaesa-Dae's arms.  But as time went on, Kakibaesa-Dae started winning more and more, and, in revenge for all the things Gaesikusaka took from him, began to instigate the fights himself.</p>
<p>Gaesikusaka, powerless against her brother, was now constantly harassed by him, and, having long-since lost his sense of sympathy to her hunger, Kakibaesa-Dae took delight in abusing her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #666;">- = - = - = -</p>
<p>Over time, Gaesikusaka's desire to eat all things turned to a desire for escape from all things, and so she began to hide.  She went from star to star, and universe to universe, but Kakibaesa-Dae could always find her, for she was unaware of the trail she left behind her; the trail of dead and broken things she constantly received, but no longer wished to devour.</p>
<p>Each time Kakibaesa-Dae caught up with her, Gaesikusaka demanded to know how she'd been found, but having long-since lost his ability to speak to her hunger, Kakibaesa-Dae could not respond.</p>
<p>On one occasion, however, as Kakibaesa-Dae approached, Gaesikusaka spotted something new and different among the favorite things he carried with him, clutched in his one remaining arm.</p>
<p>"Where did you get that, which should have been given to me?"</p>
<p>Kakibaesa-Dae could not respond, but as she asked, Gaesikusaka realized how he was following her, and the trail of things she'd left across The All.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #666;">- = - = - = -</p>
<p>Determined to no longer be followed, Gaesikusaka began to carry with her everything that she received, however eating only few of them, the number of items she had to carry quickly grew.  She dared not leave a single thing for Kakibaesa-Dae to find, however, so she bore it all, and continued to travel.</p>
<p>One day, when she thought she could go no further, Gaesikusaka happened upon one of Gizubi's many gardens, and, looking inside, saw many of Gizubi's children playing together.</p>
<p>Gaesikusaka knew it would be impossible for her - the first offspring of Rizi Vizi - to enter Gizbui's sacred garden and take shelter, but still she saw a chance for freedom.  She took all of the things she had been carrying, and put them in the garden; there, they sprung to new life and joined Gizubi's children in play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #666;">- = - = - = -</p>
<p>And so half of that which dies or is destroyed falls to Kakibaesa-Dae, whose favorites must endure his anger for all time.  But the other half goes to Gaesikusaka, who, forever hunted by her brother, gives everything to Gizbui's domain.</p>
<p>Her freedom is our freedom; her capture is our capture.  We pray for her success.

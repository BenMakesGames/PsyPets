It is enough to say that Ki Ri Kashu had always been there.  There, in chaos, a maelstrom of concepts without cohesion, ripping Itself apart, destroying Itself, endlessly.  Even Ki Ri Kashu could not endure the timeless pain.<br />

Almost before it began, it ended:  an expanding kaleidoscope of logic which linked concepts and defined existence.  In a brilliant flash of self-interpretation, Ki Ri Kashu had changed Itself from unmeaning to purpose, from the infinite everything into a finite something.  A Transformation into The All as we recognize It today.<br />

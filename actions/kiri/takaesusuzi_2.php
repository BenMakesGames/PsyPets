This is the story of Takae Su Suzi, who germinated under Gizubi's tree-staff at the dawn of Transformation.
<p>Though it had been a long time since he fashioned the Earth, Takae Su Suzi still occasionally dreamed of it.  He dreamed of cool breezes, a warm Sun, and occasional rains.  He dreamed of things he had experienced only on Earth, and only a few times, from all that time ago.  They intoxicated him, and so after awaking from one Takae Su Suzi decided to visit there again.</p>
<p>When Takae Su Suzi descended on the Earth, he immediately sensed that something was different.  Truly, there were cool breezes, a warm Sun, and occasional rains, and he reveled in them, but it was something else - something about Man - that concerned him, and so he approached them to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>&#147;Man,&#148; Takae Su Suzi said, &#147;it has been long since I visited.  What has happened while I was away?&#148;</p>
<p>But Man was terrified.  They screamed and gibbered, and ran and hid.  What few remained stood with an aggressive look in their eyes.</p>
<p>&#147;What is this?&#148; Takae Su Suzi demanded, and looked around, and listened.  Man had changed.  No longer did they tend the land, but used it instead to their advantage.  They spoke in many, new languages, and never any of those which were familiar to animals.  &#147;You have forgotten everything!&#148;  Takae Su Suzi said.  &#147;How has this happened?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;I have made it happen,&#148; someone replied.  But it was not Man.  &#147;I taught them the new languages.  I taught them how to make tools, and weapons.  I taught them to use the land.  I did these things, and they are thankful for it.&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;Who are you?&#148; Takae Su Suzi demanded, furious.  &#147;I did not put you here, nor did I give you permission to come!&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;I was born here, by that monster which you left to drown in the sea when you created this place,&#148; it replied.  &#147;She called to you for help, but you left her to die.  And she did die, but not all at once: she endured the pain of half-death until she could bear me, her only son.&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;What are you called?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;Man calls me by many names.  Enki, Raven, Elohim, Sa, Black Hactcin.  These are a few.&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;What do you call yourself?&#148;  Takae Su Suzi asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&#147;I do not,&#148; it replied, and Takae Su Suzi became scared.</p>
<p>Realizing he could not defeat this new monster alone, Takae Su Suzi left Earth, to seek out the help of Rizi Vizi.</p>
<p>&#147;Rizi Vizi,&#148; Takae Su Suzi said, bowing, &#147;you were the last of Ki Ri's offspring, the one to define endings and ultimata, to seal fates.  Your help is the only that can end my problems.  May I have it?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;For a price,&#148; Rizi Vizi replied.</p>
<p>&#147;Anything,&#148; Takae Su Suzi said, but he was nervous.  &#147;And for the secrecy of my coming here, and of the problem I ask you to end?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;For a price,&#148; Rizi Vizi replied.</p>
<p>&#147;Anything,&#148; Takae Su Suzi said again.</p>
<p>&#147;First, for the keeping of your secret I will ask you to burden another.  Should either secret be repeated to me, I will repeat the other.  Is it agreed?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;Yes,&#148; Takae Su Suzi said.  &#147;It is agreed.&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;Then let me tell you this secret, Takae Su Suzi, eldest of Gizubi's progeny: your life is owed not only to the son of Ki Ri, but to the daughter Kaera as well.  Remember this, but on our oath reveal it to no one, including your sibling parents.&#148;</p>
<p>Takae Su Suzi stood silent until, after a while, he spoke: &#147;Rizi Vizi, I have stolen from the stars and planets Kaera made, and from the garden Gizubi keeps, and with these things fashioned my own paradise.  However, something new and terrible has been born there: a nameless monster that threatens my creation.  I cannot destroy this kind of monster with my power alone.  I ask that you would do it for me.&#148;</p>
<p>Rizi Vizi laughed, and said: &#147;A monster that rivals Takae.  What kind of monster is this?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;It is the child of another monster.  A monster from Gizubi's garden.&#148;</p>
<p>Rizi Vizi laughed again, and said: &#147;The cost of this monster's destruction is too high for you to pay, Takae.&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;I will pay anything!&#148; Takae Su Suzi said.</p>
<p>&#147;I warn you not to say so again, or I will have to accept your offer.  Instead consider another deal:  I will banish the monster and its lineage from your paradise, however in exchange you and your lineage must also never visit, else the seal will be broken.  Is it agreed?&#148;</p>
<p>Again Takae Su Suzi was struck silent.  &#147;It is agreed, Rizi Vizi,&#148; he said at last.</p>
<p>&#147;Then take me to this monster, and I will see to everything.&#148;</p>
<p>So Takae Su Suzi showed Rizi Vizi the Earth and called out to the nameless monster, who appeared, and seeing Rizi Vizi bowed, instantly recognizing him as a child of Ki Ri.</p>
<p>Rizi Vizi said, &#147;nameless monster, I have come to make you a deal.  On my tongue rests the story of your existence, and with it your name.  Come, and listen.&#148;</p>
<p>It approached Rizi Vizi and leaned in closely, terrified as it listened.</p>
<p>Then Rizi Vizi said, &#147;this story is now yours alone, however you know better than any that The All must not stay incomplete.  So I propose to you my deal: the story will remain hidden, but in exchange you must hide yourself, deep in the center of this planet.  Failing that, your story will be told.  Is it agreed?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;Why must this one know of my deal?&#148; it said, facing Takae Su Suzi.</p>
<p>&#147;Because that is part of his deal.  Is it agreed?&#148;</p>
<p>&#147;It is agreed,&#148; it said, and watched Takae Su Suzi leave Earth while he burrowed deep into it.

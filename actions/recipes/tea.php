<p>A friend of mine suggests making Mint Tea Candles directly out of Mint Tea.  She uses them for a spell she calls "Patience's Reward".</p>
<p>For this spell she lines up, in this order, a Vanilla Candles, a plain white Candle, and a Mint Tea Candle.  After burning these in the house all day, she reports feeling very creative and energetic.  I'm not surprised, given the delightful smell that must permeate every room of her house!</p>

<p><i>The book is written in some strange language, however it looks like someone has done some translations in the margins...</i></p>
<div style="padding-left: 2em;">
<p>I fear now that I am not only at the end of my days, but that I will not be able to complete the research I began so many years ago.</p>
<p>[...] I pray that they will find this notebook, and gain what I was not able to: immortality.</p>
<p style="padding-top:2em;">The order of the candles is as follows:</p>
<p><b>White, Black, Vanilla, Black, White</b></p>
<p>Though I confess it is far from complete. [...] I would never use it upon myself, for though it would surely reanimate my body, I would not truly be alive.</p>
<p style="padding-top:2em;">The bodies animated by this spell are savage.  [...] hunger - perhaps acting on some base instinct - however do not fear for their lives [...] they are unquestionably mortal.  In fact, I have killed precisely as many as I have raised.</p>
<p>I want to believe that their minds, brought back, are so incomplete - so fragmented - that many of their basic survival insticts are missing.  [...] a part of me cannot shake the possibility of a chilling alternative: that their minds are restored with a completeness such that, realizing what they have become, they wish to die again.</p>
<p>I have not yet devised an experiment to test this [...]</p>

<p><i>That is all that is translated.</i></p>

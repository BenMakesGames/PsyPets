</blockquote>

<p>if [somehow] they do not come at the rehearsing of these 2 fforegoeing
Conjurations (but without doubt they [normally] will) say one [on] as
ffolloweth, it being a constraint.</p>

<h3>[The Constraint]</h3>
<blockquote class="conjuration">
I conjure the [thee] spirit <strong>N.</strong> by all the most
glorious and Effacius [efficacious] names of the most great and
Incomprehensible Lord god of Host [Hosts], that you comest quickly
without delay ffrom all parts and places of the world:
[wherever thou mayest be,] to make rationell answers to my demands
and that visible and affably speakeing with a voice
Intellegible to my understanding as aforesaid, I conjure and
constrain you spirit N., by all aforesaid and by these seven
names by w<sup>ch</sup> wise Salomon bound thee and thy fellows
in a vessel of Brass. <strong>Adonay, Prerai Tetragrammaton;
Anephexeton</strong> [Anaphexeton], <strong>Inessenfatall,
Pathatumon, &amp; Itemon.</strong> That you appeare hear before
this Circle, to fullfill my will in all things, that shall seeme
good unto me and if you be disobedient and refuse to come I will
in the power and by the power of the name of y<sup>e</sup>
supream and Everliving god, Who created both you and me and
all the whole world in six days and what is contained in it
<strong>Eye-Saray</strong>, and by the power
of his name <strong>Primeumaton</strong>; which commandeth the
whole hoste of heaven, curse you and deprive you, from all your
office, Joy &amp; place, and binde you in the debth [depth]
of y<sup>e</sup> Bottomless pit There to remaine unto the day of
the last Judgement, and I will bind you into Eternall fire &amp;
into the lake of fire and Brimstone, unless you come forthwith and
appeare heere before this Circle to doe my will in all things.
Therefore com [thou!] in and by these holly names <strong>Adonay,
Zebeoth</strong> [Zebaoth], <strong>Adonay, Amiorem;</strong>
come yee, <strong>Adonay</strong> commandeth you.
</blockquote>

<p>If you come so farr, and he yet doth not appeare you may be sure he
is sent to some other place by his king, and cannot come and if it be
so Invocate the king as followeth to send him, But if he doth not come
still, Then you may be sure he is bound in chains in hell: and he is
not in the Custody of his king: So if you have a desier to call him
ffrom thence, you must rehearse the spirits Chaine &amp;c.</p>

<h3>For to Invocate the Kinge say as ffolloweth -</h3>
<blockquote class="conjuration">
O you great mighty and Powerfull kinge <strong>Amaymon</strong>, who beareth
rule by the power of thy supreame god <strong>El</strong> over all spirits both
superior and Inferiour of the Infernal order in the Dominion of
the Earth [East], I invocate and command you by the especial and truest
name of your god and by god that you worship and obey, and by
the seal of y<sup>e</sup> Creation, &amp; by the most mighty &amp; powerfull
name of god <strong>Jehovah Tetragrammaton</strong>, who cast you ought [out] of heaven
with all other of the Infernall spirits and by all y<sup>e</sup> most powerfull
and great names of god who created heaven, Earth &amp; hell, and all things
contained in them, and by their power and vertue, &amp; by y<sup>e</sup> name
<strong>Primeumaton</strong> who commandeth the whole host of heaven, that you
cause, enforce &amp; compell N. to come unto me hear before this
Circle in a fair &amp; comely forme, without doeing any harme to
me or any other Creature, and to answere truely &amp; faithfull
to all my Requests, That I may accomplish my will and desiers,
in knowing or obtaining any matter or thing w<sup>ch</sup> by office you
know is proper for him to performe or to accomplish, threw [through] the
power of god <strong>El</strong> who createth and disposeth of all things
both celestiall, ayerall [aerial], Terrestiall [terrestrial] and Infernall.
</blockquote>

<p>After you have Invocated the king in this manner twise or thrice
over, then conjure y<sup>e</sup> spirit you would have calld forth by
the aforsaid conjurations rehearsing them severall times together,
and he will come without doubt if not at y<sup>e</sup> first or second
time rehearsing. But if he doth not come, add the spirits Chaine to
the end of y<sup>e</sup> afforsaid Conjuration and he will be forced to
come even if he be Bound in chains: for the chaines will break of [off]
from him and he will be at liberty &amp;c.</p>

<h3>The generall Curse, called the spirits Chaine against all spirits
that Rebell.</h3>

<blockquote class="conjuration">
O thou wicked and disobedient spirit, because thou hast rebelled
and not obeyed nor regarded my words which I have rehearsed They
being all most glorious and Incomprehensible names of y<sup>e</sup> true

the power of those names w<sup>ch</sup> no creature is able to resist
doe curse you into the debts [! depths] of y<sup>e</sup> Bottomless Pitt,
There to remaine untill y<sup>e</sup> day of doom in chaines of fire
and Brimstone unquenchable, unless you dost forthwith appear before

these names -- <strong>Adonai</strong> [Adonay], <strong>Zebaoth,
Adonay, Amioram</strong>; come come why stay you, <strong>Adonay</strong>
comandeth you.
</blockquote>

<p>When you have read so farr and he doth not come, Then write his name
and seal in [on] virgins parch [parchment] and put it into a black
Box with Brimstone aquafateda [assafoetida] and such things that have
a stincking strong smell and bind the Box round with a wire and hang
it on y<sup>e</sup> swords point and hold it over the fire of Charcoles,
and say to the fire first [as followeth] (it being placed toward
that quarter the spirit is to come)</p>

<h3>[The Conjuration of the fire]</h3>
<blockquote class="conjuration">
I conjure <S>thee</S> you [O] fire by him that made thee and all other good
creatures in the world that you Torment Burne and consume this
spirit N. everlastingly. I condem [condemn] thee thou spirit N.

not the command, nor kept the precepts of the lord thy god,
neither wilt thou appeare to me nor obey me nor my invocations,

most high and Imperiall Lord, god of hosts <strong>Jehovah</strong>,

burne thee in immortall fire and bury thee in Immortall oblivion,
unless thou Immediately comest &amp; appearest visibly, affably,
frendly, &amp; curteously hear unto me before this Circle in this
Triangle, in a faire and comly forme and in no wise terrible, hurtfull
or frightfull to me or any other creatures whatever upon the face
of the Earth and make rationel Answers to my requests and performe
all my desiers in all things that I shall make unto you &amp;c.

<p>If he cometh not yet, say as followeth:</p>

<h3>[The curse]</h3>
<blockquote class="conjuration">
Now o thou spirit N. since thou art still pertonalius [pernicious] and
disobedient and will not appeare unto me to answer to such things as I shoulde

the name and by the power and dignity of the omnipotent Immortall
Lord god of host <strong>Jehovah Tetragrammaton</strong>, The only creator of

into that lake of fire which is prepared for thee damned and
cursed spirits and there to remain untill the day
of doome and never more to be remembered of before the face of god w<sup>ch</sup>
shall come to Judge the quick and the dead and the world by fire.
</blockquote>

<p>Here the Exorcist must put the box into the fire and by and by
he will come. But as soone as he is come quickly quench the fire
that the Box is in and make a sweet perfume and give him a kind
entertainment shewing him the pentacle that is at y<sup>e</sup> bottom
of y<sup>e</sup> vesture covered with linnen cloath, saying.</p>

<h3>[The address unto the spirit upon his coming]</h3>
<blockquote class="conjuration">

answers to my demands and be obedient to me your master in
the name of y<sup>e</sup> Lord <strong>Bathat</strong> rushing upon
<strong>Abrac Abeor</strong> coming upon <strong>Aberer</strong>.
</blockquote>

<p>Then they or he will be obedient and bid you ask what you will
for they are subjected by god to fullfill your desiers and demands,
and when they or he are appeared and shewed themselves humble
and meek, Then you are to say [as followeth]:</p>

<h3>[The welcome unto the spirit]</h3>

<blockquote class="conjuration">

<h3>The licence to depart</h3>
<blockquote class="conjuration">

Amen.
</blockquote>

<p>After you have given the spirit licence [to depart] you are not
to go out of y<sup>e</sup> Circle till they be gone and you have made
prayers unto god ffor the great blessing he hath bestowed upon
you in granting you your desiers and delivering you from the
malice of the Enemy the devill.</p>

<p>Nota [Note] you may command these spirits into the Brazen vessell
as you doe into the Triangle saying That you forthwith appeare before
this Circle in this vessell of Brasse in a faire and
comely shape &ampc as is shewed before in the forgoing Conjurations &amp;c.</p>

<p class="centered"><b>The Top 10 Weirdest Creatures of Hollow Earth</b></p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/giraffe.gif" align="left" alt="" />10. Giraffe</h5>
<p>Descendents of the Short-necked Giraffe, which were hunted to extinction in Hollow Earth for their prized vertebrae.</p>
<p>It is generally considered ironic that those that survived and escaped to Earth later evolved longer necks.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/snail.gif" align="left" alt="" />9. Giant Snail</h5>
<p>One theory suggests that a mad scientist used his Expandy Ray Gun on the common snail, resulting in this species.  Expandy and Shrinky Ray technology is fatal to complex life, however, casting some doubt on this theory.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/eagle-spider.gif" align="left" alt="" />8. Eagle Spider</h5>
<p>The Eagle Spider's eggs are said to be among the most savory and delicious.  The Eagle-Spider is viciously protective of its eggs, however, and has proven impossible to tame, so few people ever have the privilege of trying one.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/whyabutterfly.gif" align="left" alt="" />7. Flutterby</h5>
<p>Though similar in appearance to Earth's butterfly, the Flutterby is not an insect, but a winged arachnid.  It uses its appearance to attract true butterflies to its web, where it traps and devours them.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/floaty.gif" align="left" alt="" />6. Floaty</h5>
<p>The Floaty moves in a peculiar way, sometimes darting - stop-and-go - and othertimes gently drifting.</p>
<p>Upon discovery, their strange motions were compared to the way floaters in your eyes move, lending them their name.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/dotdotdot.png" align="left" alt="" />5. Horned Riksmal</h5>
<p>Ancient mythology contains stories about the origins of this creature.  It is said to be the descendent of a The Bones that got in such a terrible fight that its teeth were knocked upside-down, and straight through the top of its head!  (This also "explains" the color of the creature's horns.)</p>
<p>Modern science has ruled out any relationship between The Bones and the Horned Riksmal.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/egg.png" align="left" alt="" />4. Flying Egg</h5>
<p>An artificial creation resulting from a failed magic experiment, if the arcane texts of Rickman T. Aberystwyth are to be believed.</p>
<p>It reproduces by hatching, a process which is always fatal to the parent.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/robotorflan.gif" align="left" alt="" />3. Robot || Flan</h5>
<p>Another artificial creation described by Rickman T. Aberystwyth, this is a mechanized flan.</p>
<p>Rickman documents the circumstances of its creation in detail, which involves a grandfather clock, an unstable shelf containing largely Pyrium, and her favorite after-dinner desert: flan.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/porkfish.png" align="left" alt="" />2. Porkfish</h5>
<p>The common Catfish was genetically engineered (by introducing pig genes) to give birth to its young rather than lay them, however this alone did not produce the Porkfish.  It was later discovered - by accident - that these genetically engineered Catfish could mate with the common Pig, producing fertile offspring!  These offspring were later dubbed Porkfish, and have since proven to be hardy and intelligent creatures.</p>

<h5><img src="gfx/pets/fooshywidgit.png" align="left" alt="" />1. Flowering Widgit</h5>
<p>This strange, half-plant creature lives two lives: during the night it behaves as a carniverous animal, hunting insects for food; during the day it sleeps in bushes with its stalks sticking out.  These stalks bear flower which, when fertilized, grow a pitted, fleshy "fruit" that resembles a peach.  When this fruit falls off, a baby hatches out of the pit and eats its way through the surrounding fruit and into the open air.</p>

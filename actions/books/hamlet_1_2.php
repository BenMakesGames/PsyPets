SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants</i><br>
KING CLAUDIUS<br>
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death<br>
The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br>
To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br>
Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--<br>
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br>
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br>
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--<br>
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd<br>
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br>
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br>
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death<br>
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br>
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,<br>
Importing the surrender of those lands<br>
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br>
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br>
Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--<br>
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br>
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress<br>
His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br>
The lists and full proportions, are all made<br>
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br>
Giving to you no further personal power<br>
To business with the king, more than the scope<br>
Of these delated articles allow.<br>
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.<br>
<br>
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND <br>
In that and all things will we show our duty.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</i><br>
<br>
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?<br>
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?<br>
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br>
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br>
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br>
The head is not more native to the heart,<br>
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br>
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br>
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
My dread lord,<br>
Your leave and favour to return to France;<br>
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,<br>
To show my duty in your coronation,<br>
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,<br>
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France<br>
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br>
By laboursome petition, and at last<br>
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:<br>
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,<br>
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br>
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br>
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br>
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br>
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:<br>
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,<br>
Passing through nature to eternity.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ay, madam, it is common.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
If it be,<br>
Why seems it so particular with thee?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'<br>
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br>
Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br>
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,<br>
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br>
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,<br>
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br>
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,<br>
For they are actions that a man might play:<br>
But I have that within which passeth show;<br>
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br>
To give these mourning duties to your father:<br>
But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br>
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br>
In filial obligation for some term<br>
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever<br>
In obstinate condolement is a course<br>
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;<br>
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br>
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br>
An understanding simple and unschool'd:<br>
For what we know must be and is as common<br>
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>
Why should we in our peevish opposition<br>
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,<br>
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>
To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br>
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>
From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br>
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth<br>
This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br>
As of a father: for let the world take note,<br>
You are the most immediate to our throne;<br>
And with no less nobility of love<br>
Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br>
Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br>
In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>
It is most retrograde to our desire:<br>
And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br>
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:<br>
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br>
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br>
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,<br>
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,<br>
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br>
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,<br>
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt all but HAMLET</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt<br>
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!<br>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd<br>
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br>
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,<br>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br>
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,<br>
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br>
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br>
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:<br>
So excellent a king; that was, to this,<br>
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br>
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br>
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br>
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,<br>
As if increase of appetite had grown<br>
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--<br>
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--<br>
A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br>
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,<br>
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--<br>
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,<br>
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,<br>
My father's brother, but no more like my father<br>
Than I to Hercules: within a month:<br>
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br>
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br>
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br>
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br>
It is not nor it cannot come to good:<br>
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO</i><br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Hail to your lordship!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I am glad to see you well:<br>
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:<br>
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
My good lord--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.<br>
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
A truant disposition, good my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I would not hear your enemy say so,<br>
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,<br>
To make it truster of your own report<br>
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.<br>
But what is your affair in Elsinore?<br>
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;<br>
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats<br>
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br>
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br>
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!<br>
My father!--methinks I see my father.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Where, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
In my mind's eye, Horatio.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
He was a man, take him for all in all,<br>
I shall not look upon his like again.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Saw? who?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
My lord, the king your father.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
The king my father!<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Season your admiration for awhile<br>
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,<br>
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,<br>
This marvel to you.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
For God's love, let me hear.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br>
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,<br>
In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br>
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,<br>
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br>
Appears before them, and with solemn march<br>
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd<br>
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,<br>
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled<br>
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br>
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<br>
And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br>
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,<br>
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br>
The apparition comes: I knew your father;<br>
These hands are not more like.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
But where was this?<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Did you not speak to it?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
My lord, I did;<br>
But answer made it none: yet once methought<br>
It lifted up its head and did address<br>
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br>
But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br>
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br>
And vanish'd from our sight.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
'Tis very strange.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;<br>
And we did think it writ down in our duty<br>
To let you know of it.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.<br>
Hold you the watch to-night?<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS BERNARDO <br>
We do, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Arm'd, say you?<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS BERNARDO <br>
Arm'd, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
From top to toe?<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS BERNARDO <br>
My lord, from head to foot.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Then saw you not his face?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What, look'd he frowningly?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Pale or red?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Nay, very pale.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
And fix'd his eyes upon you?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Most constantly.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I would I had been there.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
It would have much amazed you.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS BERNARDO <br>
Longer, longer.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Not when I saw't.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
His beard was grizzled--no?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br>
A sable silver'd.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I will watch to-night;<br>
Perchance 'twill walk again.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
I warrant it will.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
If it assume my noble father's person,<br>
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br>
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,<br>
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,<br>
Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br>
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,<br>
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:<br>
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:<br>
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,<br>
I'll visit you.<br>
<br>
All <br>
Our duty to your honour.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt all but HAMLET</i><br>
<br>
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;<br>
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!<br>
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,<br>
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>

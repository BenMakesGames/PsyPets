SCENE I. A room in the castle.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</i><br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,<br>
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,<br>
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet<br>
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
He does confess he feels himself distracted;<br>
But from what cause he will by no means speak.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,<br>
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,<br>
When we would bring him on to some confession<br>
Of his true state.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Did he receive you well?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Most like a gentleman.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
But with much forcing of his disposition.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,<br>
Most free in his reply.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Did you assay him?<br>
To any pastime?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players<br>
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;<br>
And there did seem in him a kind of joy<br>
To hear of it: they are about the court,<br>
And, as I think, they have already order<br>
This night to play before him.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
'Tis most true:<br>
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties<br>
To hear and see the matter.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
With all my heart; and it doth much content me<br>
To hear him so inclined.<br>
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,<br>
And drive his purpose on to these delights.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
We shall, my lord.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</i><br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;<br>
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,<br>
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here<br>
Affront Ophelia:<br>
Her father and myself, lawful espials,<br>
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,<br>
We may of their encounter frankly judge,<br>
And gather by him, as he is behaved,<br>
If 't be the affliction of his love or no<br>
That thus he suffers for.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
I shall obey you.<br>
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish<br>
That your good beauties be the happy cause<br>
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues<br>
Will bring him to his wonted way again,<br>
To both your honours.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
Madam, I wish it may.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE</i><br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,<br>
We will bestow ourselves.<br>
<br>
<i>To OPHELIA</i><br>
<br>
Read on this book;<br>
That show of such an exercise may colour<br>
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--<br>
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage<br>
And pious action we do sugar o'er<br>
The devil himself.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
[Aside] O, 'tis too true!<br>
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!<br>
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,<br>
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it<br>
Than is my deed to my most painted word:<br>
O heavy burthen!<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</i><br>
<br>
<i>Enter HAMLET</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause: there's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life;<br>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br>


The insolence of office and the spurns<br>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself might his quietus make<br>
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death,<br>
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br>
With this regard their currents turn awry,<br>
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!<br>
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
Be all my sins remember'd.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
Good my lord,<br>
How does your honour for this many a day?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,<br>
That I have longed long to re-deliver;<br>
I pray you, now receive them.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
No, not I;<br>
I never gave you aught.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;<br>
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed<br>
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,<br>
Take these again; for to the noble mind<br>
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br>
There, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ha, ha! are you honest?<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
My lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Are you fair?<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
What means your lordship?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should<br>
admit no discourse to your beauty.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than<br>
with honesty?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner<br>
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the<br>
force of honesty can translate beauty into his<br>
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the<br>
time gives it proof. I did love you once.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot<br>
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of<br>
it: I loved you not.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
I was the more deceived.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a<br>
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;<br>
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it<br>
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very<br>
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at<br>
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,<br>
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them<br>
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling<br>
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,<br>
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.<br>
Where's your father?<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
At home, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the<br>
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
O, help him, you sweet heavens!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for<br>
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as<br>
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a<br>
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs<br>
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough<br>
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,<br>
and quickly too. Farewell.<br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
O heavenly powers, restore him!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God<br>
has given you one face, and you make yourselves<br>
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and<br>
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness<br>
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath<br>
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:<br>
those that are married already, all but one, shall<br>
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a<br>
nunnery, go.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>
<br>
OPHELIA <br>
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!<br>
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;<br>
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,<br>
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,<br>
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!<br>
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,<br>
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,<br>
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,<br>
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;<br>
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth<br>
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,<br>
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!<br>
<br>
<i>Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</i><br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Love! his affections do not that way tend;<br>
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,<br>
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,<br>
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;<br>
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose<br>
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,<br>
I have in quick determination<br>
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,<br>
For the demand of our neglected tribute<br>
Haply the seas and countries different<br>
With variable objects shall expel<br>
This something-settled matter in his heart,<br>
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus<br>
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
It shall do well: but yet do I believe<br>
The origin and commencement of his grief<br>
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!<br>
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;<br>
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;<br>
But, if you hold it fit, after the play<br>
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him<br>
To show his grief: let her be round with him;<br>
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear<br>
Of all their conference. If she find him not,<br>
To England send him, or confine him where<br>
Your wisdom best shall think.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
It shall be so:<br>
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt</i><br>

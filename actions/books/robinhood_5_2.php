<p>But now we shall follow Sir Richard, so listen, and you shall 
hear what befell him, and how he paid his debts at Emmet 
Priory, and likewise in due season to Robin Hood.</p>
 
<h4 class="centered">How Sir Richard of the Lea paid his Debts to Emmet</h4>
 
<p>The long highway stretched straight on, gray and dusty in the 
sun. On either side were dykes full of water bordered by osiers, 
and far away in the distance stood the towers of Emmet Priory 
with tall poplar trees around.</p>

<p>Along the causeway rode a knight with a score of stout men-at-arms
behind him. The Knight was clad in a plain long robe of 
gray serge, gathered in at the waist with a broad leathern belt, 
from which hung a long dagger and a stout sword. But though he 
was so plainly dressed himself, the horse he rode was a noble 
barb, and its trappings were rich with silk and silver bells.</p>

<p>So thus the band journeyed along the causeway between the 
dykes, till at last they reached the great gate of Emmet Priory. 
There the Knight called to one of his men and bade him knock 
at the porter's lodge with the haft of his sword.</p>

<p>The porter was drowsing on his bench within the lodge, but at 
the knock he roused himself and, opening the wicket, came hob- 
bling forth and greeted the Knight, whilst a tame starling that 
hung in a wicker cage within piped out, "In codo quiesl In coe/o 
quiesl" such being the words that the poor old lame porter had 
taught him to speak.</p>

<p>"Where is thy prior?" asked the Knight of the old porter.</p>

<p>"He is at meat, good knight, and he looketh for thy coming," 
quoth the porter, "for, if I mistake not, thou art Sir Richard o' 
the Lea."</p>

<p>"I am Sir Richard of the Lea, then I will go seek him forthwith/' 
said the Knight.</p>

<p>"But shall I not send thy horse to stable?" said the porter. "By 
Our Lady, it is the noblest nag, and the best harnessed, that e'er 
I saw in all my life before." And he stroked the horse's flank with 
his palm.</p>

<p>"Nay," quoth Sir Richard, "the stables of this place are not 
for me, so make way, I prythee." So saying he pushed forward, 
and, the gates being opened, he entered the stony courtyard of 
the Priory, his men behind him. In they came with rattle of steel 
and clashing of swords, and ring of horses' feet on cobble-stones, 
whereat a flock of pigeons that strutted in the sun flew with flap- 
ping wings to the high eaves of the round towers.</p>

<p>Whilst the Knight was riding along the causeway to Emmet, a 
merry feast was toward in the refectory there. The afternoon sun 
streamed in through the great arched windows, and lay in broad 
squares of light upon the stone floor and across the board covered 
with a snowy linen cloth, whereon was spread a princely feast. 
At the head of the table sat Prior Vincent of Emmet all clad in 
soft robes of fine cloth and silk; on his head was a black velvet 
cap picked out with gold, and around his neck hung a heavy 
chain of gold, with a great locket pendant therefrom. Beside him, 
on the arm of his great chair, roosted his favorite falcon, for the 
Prior was fond of the gentle craft of hawking. On his right hand 
sat the Sheriff of Nottingham in rich robes of purple all trimmed 
about with fur, and on his left a famous doctor of law in dark 
and sober garb. Below these sat the high cellarer of Emmet, and 
others chief among the brethren.</p>

<p>Jest and laughter passed around, and all was as merry as merry 
could be. The weazened face of the man of law was twisted into 
a wrinkled smile, for in his pouch were fourscore golden angels 
that the Prior had paid him in fee for the case betwixt him and 
Sir Richard of the Lea. The learned doctor had been paid before 
hand, for he had not overmuch trust in the holy Vincent of Emmet.</p>

<p>Quoth the Sheriff of Nottingham, "But art thou sure, Sir Prior, 
that thou hast the lands so safe?"</p>

<p>"Ay, marry," said Prior Vincent, smacking his lips after a deep 
draught of wine; "I have kept a close watch upon him, albeit he 
was unawares of the same, and I know right well that he hath no 
money to pay me withal."</p>

<p>"Ay, true," said the man of law in a dry, husky voice, "his land 
is surely forfeit if he cometh not to pay, but, Sir Prior, thou must 
get a release beneath his sign manual, or else thou canst not hope 
to hold the land without trouble from him."</p>

<p>"Yea," said the Prior, "so thou hast told me ere now, but I know 
that this knight is so poor that he will gladly sign away his lands 
for two hundred pounds of hard money." 

<p>Then up spake the high cellarer: "Methinks it is a shame to so 
drive a misfortunate knight to the ditch. I think it sorrow that 
the noblest estate in Derbyshire should so pass away from him 
for a paltry five hundred pounds. Truly, I" &mdash;</p> 

<p>"How now," broke in the Prior, in a quivering voice, his eyes 
glistening and his cheeks red with anger, "dost thou prate to my 
very beard, sirrah? By Saint Hubert, thou hadst best save thy 
breath to cool thy pottage, else it may scald thy mouth."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the man of law, smoothly, "I dare swear this same 
knight will never come to settlement this day, but will prove recreant. 
Nevertheless, we will seek some means to gain his lands 
from him, so never fear."</p>

<p>But even as the doctor spoke there came a sudden clatter of 
horses' hoofs and a jingle of iron mail in the courtyard below. 
Then up spake the Prior, and called upon one of the brethren that 
sat below the salt, and bade him look out of the window and 
see who was below, albeit he knew right well it could be none but 
Sir Richard.</p>

<p>So the brother arose and went and looked, and he said, "I see 
below a score of stout men-at-arms and a knight just dismounting 
from his horse. He is dressed in long robes of gray which, me- 
thinks, are of poor seeming; but the horse he rideth upon hath 
the richest coursing that ever I saw. The Knight dismounts and 
they come this way, and are even now below in the great hall."</p>

<p>"Lo, see ye there now," quoth Prior Vincent. "Here ye have a 
knight with so lean a purse as scarce to buy him a crust of bread 
to munch, yet he keeps a band of retainers, and puts rich trappings
upon his horse's hide, whilst his own back goeth bare. Is it 
not well that such men should be brought low?"</p> 

<p>"But art thou sure," said the little doctor, tremulously, "that 
this knight will do us no harm? Such as he are fierce when crossed, 
and he hath a band of naughty men at his heels. Mayhap thou 
hadst better give an extension of his debt." Thus he spake, for he 
was afraid Sir Richard might do him a harm.</p>

<p>"Thou needst not fear," said the Prior, looking down at the little 
man beside him. "This knight is gentle, and would as soon think 
of harming an old woman as thee."</p>

<p>As the Prior finished, a door at the lower end of the refectory 
swung open, and in came Sir Richard, with folded hands and head 
bowed upon his breast. Thus humbly he walked slowly up the 
hall, whilst his men-at-arms stood about the door. When he had 
come to where the Prior sat, he knelt upon one knee. "Save and 
keep thee, Sir Prior," said he; "I am come to keep my day."</p>

<p>Then the first word that the Prior said to him was, "Hast thou 
brought my money?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I have not so much as one penny upon my body," said 
the Knight; whereat the Prior's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"Now, thou art a shrewd debtor, I wot," said he. Then, "Sir 
Sheriff, I drink to thee."</p>

<p>But still the Knight kneeled upon the hard stones, so the Prior 
turned to him again. "What wouldst thou have?" quoth he, 
sharply.</p>

<p>At these words, a slow red mounted into the Knight's cheeks, 
but still he knelt. "I would crave thy mercy," said he. "As thou 
hopest for Heaven's mercy, show mercy to me. Strip me not of my 
lands, and so reduce a true knight to poverty."</p>

<p>"Thy day is broken and thy lands forfeit," said the man of law, 
plucking up his spirits at the Knight's humble speech.</p>

<p>Quoth Sir Richard, "Thou man of law, wilt thou not befriend 
me in mine hour of need?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said the other, "I hold with this holy Prior, who hath 
paid me my fees in hard gold, so that I am bounden to him."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou not be my friend, Sir Sheriff?" said Sir Richard.</p>

<p>"Nay, 'fore Heaven," quoth the Sheriff of Nottingham, "this is 
no business of mine, yet I will do what I may," and he nudged the 
Prior beneath the cloth with his knee. "Wilt thou not ease him of 
some of his debts, Sir Prior?"</p>

<p>At this the Prior smiled grimly. "Pay me three hundred pounds, 
Sir Richard," said he, "and I will give thee quittance of thy debt."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest, Sir Prior, that it is as easy for me to pay four 
hundred pounds as three hundred," said Sir Richard. "But wilt 
thou not give me another twelvemonth to pay my debt?"</p>

<p>"Not another day," said the Prior, sternly.</p>

<p>"And is this all thou wilt do for me?" asked the Knight.</p>

<p>"Now, out upon thee, false Knight!" cried the Prior, bursting 
forth in anger. "Either pay thy debt as I have said or release thy 
land, and get thee gone from out my hall."</p>

<p>Then Sir Richard arose to his feet. "Thou false, lying priest!" 
said he, in so stern a voice that the man of law shrunk af- 
frighted, "I am no false knight, as thou knowest full well, but 
have ever held my place in the press and the tourney. Hast thou 
so little courtesy that thou wouldst see a true knight kneel for all 
this time, or see him come into thy hall and never offer him meat 
or drink?"</p>

<p>Then quoth the man of law, in a trembling voice, "This is 
surely an ill way to talk of matters appertaining to business. Let 
us be mild in speech. What wilt thou pay this knight, Sir Prior, to 
give thee release of his land?"</p>

<p>"I would have given him two hundred pounds," quoth the 
Prior, "but since he hath spoken so vilely to my teeth, not one 
groat over one hundred pounds will he get!"</p>

<p>"Hadst thou offered me a thousand pounds, false Prior," said the 
Knight, "thou wouldst not have got an inch of my land." Then, 
turning to where his men-at-arms stood near the door, he called, 
"Come hither," and beckoned with his finger; whereupon the 
tallest of them all came forward and handed him a long leathern 
bag. Sir Richard took the bag and shot from it upon the table a 
glittering stream of golden money. "Bear in mind, Sir Prior," said 
he, "that thou hast promised me quittance for three hundred 
pounds. Not one farthing above that shalt thou get!" So saying, he 
counted out three hundred pounds and pushed it toward the 
Prior.</p>

<p>But now the Prior's hands dropped at his sides and the Prior's 
head hung upon his shoulder, for not only had he lost all hopes 
of the land, but he had forgiven the Knight one hundred pounds 
of his debt and had needlessly paid the man of law fourscore 
angels. To him he turned, and quoth he, "Give me back my 
money that thou hast."</p>

<p>"Nay," cried the other, shrilly, "it is but my fee that thou 
didst pay me, and thou gettest it not back again." And he hugged 
his gown about him.</p>

<p>"Now, Sir Prior," quoth Sir Richard, "I have held my day and 
paid all the dues demanded of me, so, as there is no more betwixt 
us, I leave this vile place straightway." So saying, he turned upon 
his heel and strode away.</p>

<p>All this time the Sheriff had been staring with wide-open eyes 
and mouth agape at the tall man-at-arms, who stood as though 
carved out of stone. At last he gasped out, "Reynold Greenleaf!"</p>

<p>At this, the tall man-at-arms, who was no other than Little John, 
turned, grinning, to the Sheriff. "I give thee good den, fair gossip," 
quoth he. "I would say, sweet Sheriff, that I have heard all thy 
pretty talk this day, and it shall be duly told unto Robin Hood. 
So, farewell for the nonce, till we meet again in Sherwood Forest." 
Then he, also, turned and followed Sir Richard down the hall, 
leaving the Sheriff, all pale and amazed, shrunk together upon his 
chair.</p>

<p>A merry feast it was to which Sir Richard came, but a sorry lot 
he left behind him, and little hunger had they for the princely 
food spread before them. Only the learned doctor was happy, for 
he had his fee.</p>

<p>But now a twelvemonth and a day has passed since Prior Vincent 
of Emmet sat at feast, as has just been told, and once more 
the mellow fall of another year has come. But the year had 
brought great change, I wot, to the lands of Sir Richard of the 
Lea; for, where before shaggy wild grasses grew upon the meadow 
lands, now all stretch away in golden stubble, betokening that a 
rich and plentiful crop had been gathered therefrom. A year had 
made a great change in the castle, also, for, where were empty 
moats and the crumbling of neglect, all was now orderly and 
well kept.</p>

<p>Bright shone the sun on battlement and tower, and in the 
blue air overhead a flock of clattering jackdaws flew around the 
gilded weathervane and spire. Then, in the brightness of the morning, 
the drawbridge fell across the moat with a rattle and clank 
of chains, the gate of the castle swung slowly open, and a 
goodly array of steel-clad men-at-arms, with a knight all clothed 
in chain-mail, as white as frost on briar and thorn of a winter 
morning, came flashing out from the castle courtyard. In his hand 
the Knight held a great spear, from the point of which fluttered 
a blood-red pennant as broad as the palm of one's hand. So this 
troop came forth from the castle, and in the midst of them walked 
three pack-horses laden with parcels of divers shapes and kinds.</p>

<p>Thus rode forth good Sir Richard of the Lea to pay his debt to 
Robin Hood this bright and merry morn. Along the highway they 
wended their way, with measured tramp of feet and rattle and 
jingle of sword and harness. Onward they marched till they 
came nigh to Denby, where, from the top of a hill, they saw, over 
beyond the town, many gay flags and streamers floating in the 
bright air. Then Sir Richard turned to the man-at-arms nearest 
to him. "What is toward yonder at Denby to-day?" quoth he.</p>

<p>"Please your worship," answered the man-at-arms, "a merry fair 
is held there to-day, and a great wrestling-match, to which many 
folk have come, for a prize hath been offered of a pipe of red 
wine, a fair golden ring, and a pair of gloves, all of which go to the 
best wrestler."</p>

<p>"Now, by my faith," quoth Sir Richard, who loved good manly 
sports right well, "this will be a goodly thing to see. Methinks we 
have time to stay a little while on our journey, and see this merry 
sport." So he turned his horse's head aside toward Denby and the 
fair, and thither he and his men made their way.</p>

<p>There they found a great hubbub of merriment. Flags and 
streamers were floating, tumblers were tumbling on the green, 
bag-pipes were playing, and lads and lasses were dancing to the 
music. But the crowd were gathered most of all around a ring 
where the wrestling was going forward, and thither Sir Richard 
and his men turned their steps.</p>

<p>Now when the judges of the wrestling saw Sir Richard coming 
and knew who he was, the chief of them came down from the 
bench where he and the others sat, and went to the Knight and 
took him by the hand, beseeching him to come and sit with them 
and judge the sport. So Sir Richard got down from his horse, 
and went with the others to the bench raised beside the ring.</p>

<p>Now there had been great doings that morning, for a certain 
yeoman named Egbert, who came from Stoke over in Staffordshire,
had thrown with ease all those that came against him, but a 
man of Denby, well known through all the countryside as William 
with the Scar, had been biding his time with the Stoke man; so, 
when Egbert had thrown every one else, stout William leaped 
into the ring. Then a tough bout followed, and at last he threw 
Egbert heavily, whereat there was a great shouting and shaking 
of hands, for all the Denby men were proud of their wrestler.</p>

<p>When Sir Richard came, he found stout William, puffed up 
by the shouts of his friends, walking up and down the ring, daring 
any one to come and try a throw with him. "Come one, come 
all!" quoth he. "Here stand I, William of the Scar, against any 
man. If there is none in Derbyshire to come against me, come all 
who will, from Nottingham, Stafford, or York, and if I do not make 
them one and all root the ground with their noses like swine in the 
forests, call me no more brave William the wrestler."</p>

<p>At this all laughed; but above all the laughter a loud voice was 
heard to cry out, "Sin' thou talkest so big, here cometh one from 
Nottinghamshire to try a fall with thee, fellow;" and straightway 
a tall youth with a tough quarterstaff in his hand came pushing 
his way through the crowd, and at last leaped lightly over the rope 
into the ring. He was not as heavy as stout William, but he was 
taller and broader in the shoulders, and all his joints were well 
knit. Sir Richard looked upon him keenly, then, turning to one 
of the judges, he said, "Knowest thou who this youth is? Methinks 
I have seen him before."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the judge, "he is a stranger to me."</p>

<p>Meantime, without a word, the young man, laying aside his 
quarterstaff, began to take off his jerkin and body clothing until 
he presently stood with naked arms and body; and a comely 
sight he was when so bared to the view, for his muscles were cut 
round and smooth and sharp like swift-running water.</p>

<p>And now each man spat upon his hands, and, clapping them 
upon his knees, squatted down, watching the other keenly, so as to 
take the vantage of him in the grip. Then like a flash they leaped 
together, and a great shout went up, for William had gotten the 
better hold of the two. For a short time they strained and struggled 
and writhed, and then stout William gave his most cunning 
trip and throw, but the stranger met it with greater skill than his, 
and so the trip came to nought. Then, of a sudden, with a twist 
and a wrench, the stranger loosed himself, and he of the scar 
found himself locked in a pair of arms that fairly made his ribs 
crack. So, with heavy, hot breathing, they stood for a while straining, 
their bodies all glistening with sweat, and great drops of 
sweat trickling down their faces. But the stranger's hug was so 
close that at last stout William's muscles softened under his grip, 
and he gave a sob. Then the youth put forth all his strength, 
and gave a sudden trip with his heel, and a cast over his right hip, 
and down stout William went, with a sickening thud, and lay as 
though he would never move hand nor foot again.</p>

<p>But now no shout went up for the stranger, but an angry murmur 
was heard among the crowd, so easily had he won the match. 
Then one of the judges, who was a kinsman to William of the 
Scar, rose with trembling lip and baleful look. Quoth he, "If thou 
hast slain that man it will go ill with thee, let me tell thee, 
fellow."</p>

<p>But the stranger answered boldly, "He took his chance with me 
as I took mine with him. No law can touch me to harm me, even if 
I slew him, so that it was fairly done in the wrestling ring."</p>

<p>"That we shall see," said the judge, scowling upon the youth, 
whilst once more an angry murmur ran around the crowd, for, as 
I have said, the men of Denby were proud of stout William of the 
Scar.</p>

<p>Then up spoke Sir Richard, gently. "Nay," said he, "the youth 
is right. If the other dieth, he dieth in the wrestling ring, where 
he took his chance, and was cast fairly enow."</p>

<p>But in the meantime three men had come forward and lifted 
stout William from the ground, and found that he was not dead, 
though badly shaken by his heavy fall. Then the chief judge 
rose and said, "Young man, the prize is duly thine. Here is the 
red gold ring, and here the gloves, and yonder stands the pipe of 
wine to do with whatsoever thou dost list."</p>

<p>At this the youth, who had donned his clothes and taken up 
his staff again, bowed, without a word, then, taking the gloves and 
the ring, and thrusting the one into his girdle and slipping the 
other upon his thumb, he turned and, leaping lightly over the 
ropes again, made his way through the crowd, and was gone.</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder who yon youth may be," said the judge, turning
to Sir Richard; "he seemeth like a stout Saxon from his red 
cheeks and fair hair. This William of ours is a stout man, too, and 
never have I seen him cast in the ring before, albeit he hath not 
yet striven with such great wrestlers as Thomas of Cornwall, 
Diccon of York, and young David of Doncaster. Hath he not a 
firm foot in the ring, thinkest thou, Sir Richard?"</p>

<p>"Ay, truly, and yet this youth threw him fairly, and with wondrous
ease. I much wonder who he can be." Thus said Sir Richard 
in a thoughtful voice.</p>

<p>For a time the Knight stood talking to those about him, but at 
last he arose and made ready to depart, so he called his men 
about him, and tightening the girths of his saddle, he mounted 
his horse once more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young stranger had made his way through the 
crowd, but, as he passed, he heard all around him such words 
muttered as, "Look at the cockerel!" "Behold how he plumeth 
himself!" "I dare swear he cast good William unfairly!" "Yea, 
truly, saw ye not bird-lime upon his hands?" "It would be well to 
cut his cock's comb!" To all this the stranger paid no heed, but 
strode proudly about as though he heard it not. So he walked 
slowly across the green to where the booth stood wherein was 
dancing, and standing at the door he looked in on the sport. As he 
stood thus a stone struck his arm of a sudden with a sharp jar, 
and, turning, he saw that an angry crowd of men had followed him 
from the wrestling ring. Then, when they saw him turn so, a great 
hooting and yelling arose from all, so that the folk came running 
out from the dancing booth to see what was to do. At last a tall, 
broad-shouldered, burly blacksmith strode forward from the crowd 
swinging a mighty blackthorn club in his hand.</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou come here to our fair town of Denby, thou Jack 
in the Box, to overcome a good honest lad with vile, juggling 
tricks?" growled he in a deep voice like the bellow of an angry 
bull. "Take that, then!" And of a sudden he struck a blow at the 
youth that might have felled an ox. But the other turned the blow 
deftly aside, and gave back another so terrible that the Denby 
man went down with a groan, as though he had been smitten 
by lightning. When they saw their leader fall the crowd gave another 
angry shout, but the stranger placed his back against the 
tent near which he stood, swinging his terrible staff, and so fell 
had been the blow that he struck the stout smith, that none dared 
to come within the measure of his cudgel, so the press crowded 
back, like a pack of dogs from a bear at bay. But now some 
coward hand from behind threw a sharp jagged stone that smote 
the stranger on the crown, so that he staggered back, and the red 
blood gushed from the cut and ran down his face and over his 
jerkin. Then, seeing him dazed with this vile blow, the crowd 
rushed upon him, so that they overbore him and he fell beneath 
their feet.</p>

<p>Now it might have gone ill with the youth, even to the losing 
of his young life, had not Sir Richard come to this fair, for of a 
sudden shouts were heard, and steel flashed in the air, and blows 
were given with the flat of swords, whilst through the midst of 
the crowd Sir Richard of the Lea came spurring on his white 
horse. Then the crowd, seeing the steel-clad knight and the armed 
men, melted away like snow on the warm hearth, leaving the 
young man all bloody and dusty upon the ground.</p>

<p>Finding himself free, the youth arose, and, wiping the blood 
from his face, looked up. Quoth he, "Sir Richard of the Lea, mayhap 
thou hast saved my life this day."</p>

<p>"Who art thou that knowest Sir Richard of the Lea so well?" 
quoth the Knight. "Methinks I have seen thy face before, young 
man."</p>

<p>"Yea, thou hast," said the youth, "for men call me David of 
Doncaster."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Sir Richard; "I wonder that I knew thee not, David, 
but thy beard hath grown longer, and thou thyself art more set 
in manhood since this day twelvemonth. Come hither into the 
tent, David, and wash the blood from thy face. And thou, Ralph, 
bring him straightway a clean jerkin. Now I am sorry for thee, 
yet I am right glad that I have had a chance to pay a part of my 
debt of kindness to thy good master, Robin Hood, for it might 
have gone ill with thee had I not come, young man."</p>

<p>So saying, the Knight led David into the tent, and there the 
youth washed the blood from his face and put on the clean jerkin.</p>

<p>In the meantime a whisper had gone around from those that 
stood nearest that this was none other than the great David of 
Doncaster, the best wrestler in all the midcountry, who only last 
spring had cast stout Adam o' Lincoln in the ring at Selby, in 
Yorkshire, and now held the midcountry champion belt. Thus it 
happened that when young David came forth from the tent along 
with Sir Richard, the blood all washed from his face, and his 
soiled jerkin changed for a clean one, no sounds of anger were 
heard, but all pressed forward to see the young man, feeling proud 
that one of the great wrestlers of England should have entered 
the ring at Denby fair. For thus fickle is a mass of men.</p>

<p>Then Sir Richard called aloud, "Friends, this is David of Doncaster, 
so think it no shame that your Denby man was cast by 
such a wrestler. He beareth you no ill-will for what hath passed, 
but let it be a warning to you how ye treat strangers henceforth. 
Had ye slain him it would have been an ill day for you, for Robin 
Hood would have harried your town as the kestrel harries the 
dove-cote. I have bought the pipe of wine from him, and now I 
give it freely to you to drink as ye list. But never hereafterwards 
fall upon a man for being a stout yeoman."</p>

<p>At this all shouted amain, but in truth they thought more of the 
wine than of the Knight's words. Then Sir Richard, with David 
beside him and his men-at-arms around, turned about and left the 
fair.</p>

<p>But in after days, when the men that saw that wrestling bout 
were bent with age, they would shake their heads when they 
heard of any stalwart game, and say, "Ay, ay, but thou shouldst 
have seen the great David of Doncaster cast stout William with 
the Scar at Denby fair."</p>

<p>Robin Hood stood in the merry greenwood with Little John and 
most of his stout yeomen around him, awaiting Sir Richard's 
coming. At last a glint of steel was seen through the brown forest 
leaves, and forth from the covert into the open rode Sir Richard 
at the head of his men. He came straight forward to Robin Hood, 
and leaping from off his horse clasped the yeoman in his arms.</p>

<p>"Why, how now," said Robin, after a time, holding Sir Richard 
off and looking at him from top to toe; "methinks thou art a gayer 
bird than when I saw thee last."</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks to thee, Robin," said the Knight, laying his hand 
upon the yeoman's shoulder. "But for thee I would have been 
wandering in misery in a far country by this time. But I have 
kept my word, Robin, and have brought back the money that thou 
didst lend me, and which I have doubled four times over again, 
and so become rich once more. Along with this money I have 
brought a little gift to thee and thy brave men from my dear lady 
and myself." Then, turning to his men, he called aloud, "Bring 
forth the pack-horses."</p>

<p>But Robin stopped them. "Nay, Sir Richard," said he, "think 
it not bold of me to cross thy bidding, but we of Sherwood do 
no business till after we have eaten and drank," whereupon, taking 
Sir Richard by the hand, he led him to the seat beneath 
the greenwood tree, whilst others of the chief men of the band 
came and seated themselves around. Then, quoth Robin, "How 
cometh it that I saw young David of Doncaster with thee and thy 
men, Sir Knight?"</p>

<p>Then straightway the Knight told all about his stay at Denby 
and of the happening at the fair, and how it was like to go hard 
with young David; so he told his tale, and quoth he, "It was this, 
good Robin, that kept me so late on the way, otherwise I would 
have been here an hour agone."</p>

<p>Then, when he had done speaking, Robin stretched out his 
hand and grasped the Knight's palm. Quoth he in a trembling 
voice, "I owe thee a debt I can never hope to repay, Sir Richard, 
for let me tell thee, I would rather lose my right hand than have 
such ill befall young David of Doncaster as seemed like to come 
upon him at Denby."</p>

<p>So they talked until after a while one came forward to say that 
the feast was spread, whereupon all arose and went thereto. When 
at last it was done, the Knight called upon his men to bring the 
pack-horses forward, which they did according to his bidding. 
Then one of the men brought the Knight a strong box, which he 
opened and took from it a bag and counted out five hundred 
pounds, the sum of the money he had gotten from Robin.</p>

<p>"Sir Richard," quoth Robin, "thou wilt pleasure us all if thou 
wilt keep that money as a gift from us of Sherwood. Is it not so, 
my lads?"</p>

<p>Then all shouted "Ay" with a mighty voice.</p>

<p>"I thank you all deeply," said the Knight, earnestly, "but think 
it not ill of me if I cannot take it. Gladly have I borrowed it 
from you, but it may not be that I can take it as a gift."</p>

<p>Then Robin Hood said no more, but gave the money to Little 
John to put away in the treasury, for he had shrewdness enough 
to know that nought breeds ill-will and heart-bitterness like gifts 
forced upon one that cannot choose but take them.</p>

<p>Then Sir Richard had the packs laid upon the ground and 
opened, whereupon a great shout went up that made the forest 
ring again, for lo, there were tenscore bows of finest Spanish yew, 
all burnished till they shone again, and each bow inlaid with fan- 
ciful figures in silver, yet not inlaid so as to mar their strength. 
Beside these were tenscore quivers of leather embroidered with 
golden thread, and in each quiver were a score of shafts with 
burnished heads that shone like silver; each shaft also was feathered
with peacock's plumes and innocked with silver.</p>

<p>Sir Richard gave to each yeoman a bow and a quiver of arrows, 
but to Robin he gave a stout bow inlaid with the cunningest 
workmanship in gold, whilst each arrow in his quiver was innocked
with gold.</p>

<p>Then all shouted again for joy of the fair gift, and all swore 
among themselves that they would die if need be for Sir Richard 
and his lady.</p>

<p>At last the time came when Sir Richard must go, whereupon 
Robin Hood called his band around him, and each man of the 
yeomen took a torch in his hand to light the way through the 
woodlands. So they came to the edge of Sherwood, and there 
the Knight kissed Robin upon the cheeks and left him and was 
gone.</p>

<p>Thus Robin Hood helped a noble knight out of his dire misfortunes, 
that else would have smothered the happiness from his life.</p>

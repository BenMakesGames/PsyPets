<p>In the beginning, the Gorgon numbered only three: the sisters Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa.  They wore great, golden wings, large tusks, and rather than hair had snakes upon their heads.  Those who beheld them would immediately be turned to stone.</p>
<p>The Gorgon were immortal, save Medusa, but for that she made up with a divine beauty.  It was her beauty that drew Poseidon, Lord of All The Sea, to ravish Medusa in Athena's temple on one day, and it was her mortality that drew Perseus to slay her on another.</p>
<p>Medusa's death was the birth of many things, which sprang forth from her decapitated body.  It was, perhaps, at this time that the lesser Gorgon we see today were born.</p>
<p>Stheno and Euryale have long since vanished.  Being immortal, however, it must be assumed that they are alive, perhaps hiding deep within some long-forgotten cave, or high up on some untraveled mountain.</p>

<h4 class="centered">Dewey Shireman's Book of Creatures: Spirits of the Hollow Earth</h4>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>My work with researchers at HERG - and Dr. Julio Beiler in particular - has been a thoroughly rewarding experience.  I have never before been as excited as I am when I learn about the wonderous creatures that Beiler, Heidel, and others are discovering in the Hollow Earth.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I have been delighted to be able to share these discoveries with the rest of the world through my <cite>Book of Creatures</cite> books.</p>
<p>That being said, <cite>Spirits of the Hollow Earth</cite> is different from my previous books.  The creatures presented here are not real-world creatures, but creatures found in Ancient Mythology.</p>
<p>For those not familiar, Ancient Mythology was the religion held by an ancient race that dwelled in the Hollow Earth.  Where this race has gone is not known, but artifacts are routinely being excavated by HERG, some of which include stories of gods and their deeds.</p>
<p>As one would expect of any mythology, Ancient Mythology includes spirits of many kinds, and it is to those spirits that this book is devoted.  It is my hope that they will instill in you the same sense of wonder as they have in me.</p>
<h5>Spirits of the Hollow Earth</h5>
<p>The spirits of Ancient Mytholgoy are only loosely comparable to what we think of as spirits today.  These are not necessarily ghosts, or the wandering souls of the dead (although some are).  They are more akin to the spirits of Greek and Roman Mythology: supernatural creatures of divine origin.</p>
<h5>Varasu-Bitae - Water Spirits</h5>

<p>The most common water spirit, curiously, is the animal which we recognize today as the Jellyfish.  Given the simultaneously beautiful and dangerous nature of the jellyfish, it is not hard to see why these were thought of as being divine creatures.</p>
<p>There are other water spirits, however, that do not seem to have any real-world equivalent.  One of the most frequently described is a ball of blue and green fire that flies low over the surfaces of lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water.  They are described as being as large as a man's head, sometimes bearing faces.</p> 
<p>Probably the most famous of water spirits in Ancient Mythology is Liku-Liku.  A behemoth of the sea, Liku-Liku is said to not only tend to the ocean's ecosystem, but to have inspired the creation of human life on Earth.</p>
<h5>Varasu-Saerikuta - Land Spirits</h5>

<p>Not only animals, but plants and rocks were also often said to wield divine power.</p>
<p>Living rocks were said to start avalanches and rock slides to harm humans who had insulted them.  Rocks in general appear to have brought many troubles to the Ancients: the common frog was thought to be a living form of rock, and not to be eaten - or even touched - lest you come down with a violent stomach ache.</p>
<p>Some bushes and trees were said to be animated, rearranging themselves in order to get people lost in the forests.</p>
<p>Overall, land spirits seemed to cause much more distress for the Ancients than any other kind of spirit.</p>
<h5>Varasu-Vaeli - Air Spirits</h5>

<p>The Ancients' understanding of clouds and their formation, movement, and dissipation via rain and snow did not appear to stop them from believing that most clouds were, if not spirits themselves, controlled by them.  While these spirits occasionally acted in ways that were inconvient or harmful to the Ancients, this was usually forgiven, as these spirits seemed inclined to water crops.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous air spirit is Gubi Raezi.  Gubi Raezi - usually welcome for the Spring rains it brought - was said to have sent down an unnaturaly thick fog during a decisive battle between two warring nations.  One story tells of a man who mistook his best friend for an enemy in the thickness of the fog, and slew him.  In any event, both sides reported great losses, for which they blamed Gubi Raezi.</p>
<p>Rainbows were attributed to enormous, flying, snake-like creatures that would wrap themselves in a ring around the Earth and glow under the light and heat of the sun.  They apparently came to drink the water of rainfall, but were often too late arriving to enjoy any.</p>
<h5>Varasu-Saka - Spirits of the Dead</h5>

<p>Rizi Vizi was said to be the god responsible for the safe keeping of the dead.  Tributes were made to Rizi Vizi, to help ensure that the job was well-done, as the dead were seen as dangerous.  To see the spirit of a departed was an extremely bad sign.  At the least, seeing a dead spirit meant you'd come down with a terrible fever.  At the worst, you could expect to die very soon.  Pregnant women who saw spirits of the dead were expected to miscarry.</p>

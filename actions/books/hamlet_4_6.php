SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter HORATIO and a Servant</i><br>
HORATIO <br>
What are they that would speak with me?<br>
<br>
Servant <br>
Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Let them come in.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit Servant</i><br>
<br>
I do not know from what part of the world<br>
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter Sailors</i><br>
<br>
First Sailor <br>
God bless you, sir.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Let him bless thee too.<br>
<br>
First Sailor <br>
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for<br>
you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was<br>
bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am<br>
let to know it is.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
[Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked<br>
this, give these fellows some means to the king:<br>
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old<br>
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us<br>
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on<br>
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded<br>
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so<br>
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with<br>
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they<br>
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king<br>
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me<br>
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I<br>
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee<br>
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of<br>
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee<br>
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their<br>
course for England: of them I have much to tell<br>
thee. Farewell.<br>
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'<br>
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;<br>
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me<br>
To him from whom you brought them.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt</i><br>

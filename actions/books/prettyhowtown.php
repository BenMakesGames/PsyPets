anyone lived in a pretty how town<br />
(with up so floating many bells down)<br />
spring summer autumn winter<br />
he sang his didn't he danced his did.<br />
<br />
Women and men (both little and small)<br />
cared for anyone not at all<br />
they sowed their isn't they reaped their same<br />
sun moon stars rain<br />

children guessed (but only a few<br />
and down they forgot as up they grew<br />
autumn winter spring summer)<br />
that noone loved him more by more<br />
<br />
when by now and tree by leaf<br />
she laughed his joy she cried his grief<br />
bird by snow and stir by still<br />
anyone's any was all to her<br />
<br />
someones married their everyones<br />
laughed their cryings and did their dance<br />
(sleep wake hope and then) they<br />
said their nevers they slept their dream<br />
<br />
stars rain sun moon<br />
(and only the snow can begin to explain<br />
how children are apt to forget to remember<br />
with up so floating many bells down)<br />
<br />
one day anyone died i guess<br />
(and noone stooped to kiss his face)<br />
busy folk buried them side by side<br />
little by little and was by was<br />
<br />
all by all and deep by deep<br />
and more by more they dream their sleep<br />
noone and anyone earth by april<br />
with by spirit and if by yes.<br />
<br />
Women and men (both dong and ding)<br />
summer autumn winter spring<br />
reaped their sowing and went their came<br />
sun moon stars rain

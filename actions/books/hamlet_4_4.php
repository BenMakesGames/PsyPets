SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching</i><br>
PRINCE FORTINBRAS <br>
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;<br>
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras<br>
Craves the conveyance of a promised march<br>
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.<br>
If that his majesty would aught with us,<br>
We shall express our duty in his eye;<br>
And let him know so.<br>
<br>
Captain <br>
I will do't, my lord.<br>
<br>
PRINCE FORTINBRAS <br>
Go softly on.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers</i><br>
<br>
<i>Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Good sir, whose powers are these?<br>
<br>
Captain <br>
They are of Norway, sir.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How purposed, sir, I pray you?<br>
<br>
Captain <br>
Against some part of Poland.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Who commands them, sir?<br>
<br>
Captain <br>
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,<br>
Or for some frontier?<br>
<br>
Captain <br>
Truly to speak, and with no addition,<br>
We go to gain a little patch of ground<br>
That hath in it no profit but the name.<br>
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;<br>
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole<br>
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.<br>
<br>
Captain <br>
Yes, it is already garrison'd.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats<br>
Will not debate the question of this straw:<br>
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,<br>
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without<br>
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.<br>
<br>
Captain <br>
God be wi' you, sir.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Wilt please you go, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I'll be with you straight go a little before.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt all except HAMLET</i><br>
<br>
How all occasions do inform against me,<br>
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,<br>
If his chief good and market of his time<br>
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.<br>
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,<br>
Looking before and after, gave us not<br>
That capability and god-like reason<br>
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be<br>
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple<br>
Of thinking too precisely on the event,<br>
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom<br>
And ever three parts coward, I do not know<br>
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'<br>
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means<br>
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:<br>
Witness this army of such mass and charge<br>
Led by a delicate and tender prince,<br>
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd<br>
Makes mouths at the invisible event,<br>
Exposing what is mortal and unsure<br>
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,<br>
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great<br>
Is not to stir without great argument,<br>
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw<br>
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,<br>
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,<br>
Excitements of my reason and my blood,<br>
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see<br>
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,<br>
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,<br>
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot<br>
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,<br>
Which is not tomb enough and continent<br>
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,<br>
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.<br>
<br>
<i>FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO</i><br>
BERNARDO<br>
Who's there?<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Long live the king!<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
Bernardo?<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
He.<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
You come most carefully upon your hour.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,<br>
And I am sick at heart.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Have you had quiet guard?<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
Not a mouse stirring.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Well, good night.<br>
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br>
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?<br>
<br>
<i>Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</i><br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
Friends to this ground.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
And liegemen to the Dane.<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
Give you good night.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
O, farewell, honest soldier:<br>
Who hath relieved you?<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO<br>
Bernardo has my place.<br>
Give you good night.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Holla! Bernardo!<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Say,<br>
What, is Horatio there?<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
A piece of him.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
I have seen nothing.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,<br>
And will not let belief take hold of him<br>
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br>
Therefore I have entreated him along<br>
With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br>
That if again this apparition come,<br>
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Sit down awhile;<br>
And let us once again assail your ears,<br>
That are so fortified against our story<br>
What we have two nights seen.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
Well, sit we down,<br>
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Last night of all,<br>
When yond same star that's westward from the pole<br>
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br>
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br>
The bell then beating one,--<br>
<br>
<i>Enter Ghost</i><br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
It would be spoke to.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Question it, Horatio.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,<br>
Together with that fair and warlike form<br>
In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br>
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
It is offended.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
See, it stalks away!<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!<br>
<br>
<i>Exit Ghost</i><br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
'Tis gone, and will not answer.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:<br>
Is not this something more than fantasy?<br>
What think you on't?<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
Before my God, I might not this believe<br>
Without the sensible and true avouch<br>
Of mine own eyes.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Is it not like the king?<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
As thou art to thyself:<br>
Such was the very armour he had on<br>
When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br>
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,<br>
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>
'Tis strange.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br>
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
In what particular thought to work I know not;<br>
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br>
Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>
So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br>
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br>
And foreign mart for implements of war;<br>
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br>
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br>
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br>
Who is't that can inform me?<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
That can I;<br>
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,<br>
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,<br>
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--<br>
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--<br>
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,<br>
Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br>
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br>
Against the which, a moiety competent<br>
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br>
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br>
And carriage of the article design'd,<br>
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br>
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>
For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--<br>
As it doth well appear unto our state--<br>
But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br>
Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>
The source of this our watch and the chief head<br>
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
I think it be no other but e'en so:<br>
Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br>
That was and is the question of these wars.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br>
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br>
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br>
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br>
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br>
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands<br>
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br>
And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>
As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>
And prologue to the omen coming on,<br>
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--<br>
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!<br>
<br>
<i>Re-enter Ghost</i><br>
<br>
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br>
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br>
Speak to me:<br>
If there be any good thing to be done,<br>
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br>
Speak to me:<br>
<br>
<i>Cock crows</i><br>
<br>
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,<br>
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br>
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br>
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br>
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br>
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Do, if it will not stand.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO <br>
'Tis here!<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
'Tis here!<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
'Tis gone!<br>
<br>
<i>Exit Ghost</i><br>
<br>
We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br>
To offer it the show of violence;<br>
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br>
And our vain blows malicious mockery.<br>
<br>
BERNARDO<br>
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
And then it started like a guilty thing<br>
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br>
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br>
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br>
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,<br>
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>
The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>
To his confine: and of the truth herein<br>
This present object made probation.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br>
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes<br>
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,<br>
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br>
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br>
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br>
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br>
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.<br>
<br>
HORATIO<br>
So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br>
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br>
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br>
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,<br>
Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br>
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br>
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br>
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br>
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS<br>
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know<br>
Where we shall find him most conveniently.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt</i><br>

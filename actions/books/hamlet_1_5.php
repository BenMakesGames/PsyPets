SCENE V. Another part of the platform.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter GHOST and HAMLET</i><br>
HAMLET <br>
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
Mark me.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I will.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
My hour is almost come,<br>
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames<br>
Must render up myself.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Alas, poor ghost!<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing<br>
To what I shall unfold.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Speak; I am bound to hear.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What?<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
I am thy father's spirit,<br>
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,<br>
And for the day confined to fast in fires,<br>
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid<br>
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br>
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br>
Thy knotted and combined locks to part<br>
And each particular hair to stand on end,<br>
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:<br>
But this eternal blazon must not be<br>
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br>
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O God!<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Murder!<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;<br>
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift<br>
As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>
May sweep to my revenge.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
I find thee apt;<br>
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br>
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:<br>
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br>
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br>
Is by a forged process of my death<br>
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,<br>
The serpent that did sting thy father's life<br>
Now wears his crown.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--<br>
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust<br>
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:<br>
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!<br>
From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>
That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>
I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>
To those of mine!<br>
But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br>
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,<br>
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,<br>
And prey on garbage.<br>
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br>
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>
My custom always of the afternoon,<br>
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br>
And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>
The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>
Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>
That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>
The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>
And with a sudden vigour doth posset<br>
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;<br>
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,<br>
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br>
All my smooth body.<br>
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand<br>
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:<br>
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,<br>
No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>
With all my imperfections on my head:<br>
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br>
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br>
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br>
A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br>


Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven<br>
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br>
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br>
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,<br>
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:<br>
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?<br>
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;<br>
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br>
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!<br>
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br>
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!<br>
Yea, from the table of my memory<br>
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br>
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br>
That youth and observation copied there;<br>
And thy commandment all alone shall live<br>
Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!<br>
O most pernicious woman!<br>
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br>
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,<br>
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;<br>
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:<br>
<br>
<i>Writing</i><br>
<br>
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;<br>
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'<br>
I have sworn 't.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS HORATIO <br>
[Within] My lord, my lord,--<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
[Within] Lord Hamlet,--<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
[Within] Heaven secure him!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
So be it!<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</i><br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
How is't, my noble lord?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
What news, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O, wonderful!<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Good my lord, tell it.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
No; you'll reveal it.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Not I, my lord, by heaven.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
Nor I, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?<br>
But you'll be secret?<br>
<br>
HORATIO MARCELLUS <br>
Ay, by heaven, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark<br>
But he's an arrant knave.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave<br>
To tell us this.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why, right; you are i' the right;<br>
And so, without more circumstance at all,<br>
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:<br>
You, as your business and desire shall point you;<br>
For every man has business and desire,<br>
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,<br>
Look you, I'll go pray.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;<br>
Yes, 'faith heartily.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
There's no offence, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,<br>
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,<br>
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:<br>
For your desire to know what is between us,<br>
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,<br>
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,<br>
Give me one poor request.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
What is't, my lord? we will.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Never make known what you have seen to-night.<br>
<br>
HORATIO MARCELLUS <br>
My lord, we will not.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Nay, but swear't.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
In faith,<br>
My lord, not I.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
Nor I, my lord, in faith.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Upon my sword.<br>
<br>
MARCELLUS <br>
We have sworn, my lord, already.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
[Beneath] Swear.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,<br>
truepenny?<br>
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--<br>
Consent to swear.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Propose the oath, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Never to speak of this that you have seen,<br>
Swear by my sword.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
[Beneath] Swear.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.<br>
Come hither, gentlemen,<br>
And lay your hands again upon my sword:<br>
Never to speak of this that you have heard,<br>
Swear by my sword.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
[Beneath] Swear.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?<br>
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br>
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;<br>
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br>
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,<br>
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br>
To put an antic disposition on,<br>
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br>
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,<br>
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br>
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'<br>
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'<br>
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note<br>
That you know aught of me: this not to do,<br>
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.<br>
<br>
Ghost <br>
[Beneath] Swear.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!<br>
<br>
<i>They swear</i><br>
<br>
So, gentlemen,<br>
With all my love I do commend me to you:<br>
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br>
May do, to express his love and friending to you,<br>
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;<br>
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br>
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,<br>
That ever I was born to set it right!<br>
Nay, come, let's go together.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt</i><br>

SCENE II. A room in the castle.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants</i><br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!<br>
Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br>
The need we have to use you did provoke<br>
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br>
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,<br>
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man<br>
Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br>
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him<br>
So much from the understanding of himself,<br>
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,<br>
That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br>
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,<br>
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br>
Some little time: so by your companies<br>
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,<br>
So much as from occasion you may glean,<br>
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,<br>
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;<br>
And sure I am two men there are not living<br>
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you<br>
To show us so much gentry and good will<br>
As to expend your time with us awhile,<br>
For the supply and profit of our hope,<br>
Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br>
As fits a king's remembrance.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Both your majesties<br>
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br>
Put your dread pleasures more into command<br>
Than to entreaty.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
But we both obey,<br>
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent<br>
To lay our service freely at your feet,<br>
To be commanded.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:<br>
And I beseech you instantly to visit<br>
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,<br>
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
Heavens make our presence and our practises<br>
Pleasant and helpful to him!<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Ay, amen!<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants</i><br>
<br>
<i>Enter POLONIUS</i><br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,<br>
Are joyfully return'd.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Thou still hast been the father of good news.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,<br>
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,<br>
Both to my God and to my gracious king:<br>
And I do think, or else this brain of mine<br>
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure<br>
As it hath used to do, that I have found<br>
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;<br>
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit POLONIUS</i><br>
<br>
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found<br>
The head and source of all your son's distemper.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
I doubt it is no other but the main;<br>
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Well, we shall sift him.<br>
<br>
<i>Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</i><br>
<br>
Welcome, my good friends!<br>
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?<br>
<br>
VOLTIMAND <br>
Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br>
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br>
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd<br>
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;<br>
But, better look'd into, he truly found<br>
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,<br>
That so his sickness, age and impotence<br>
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests<br>
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;<br>
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine<br>
Makes vow before his uncle never more<br>
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.<br>
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br>
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,<br>
And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br>
So levied as before, against the Polack:<br>
With an entreaty, herein further shown,<br>
<br>
<i>Giving a paper</i><br>
<br>
That it might please you to give quiet pass<br>
Through your dominions for this enterprise,<br>
On such regards of safety and allowance<br>
As therein are set down.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
It likes us well;<br>
And at our more consider'd time well read,<br>
Answer, and think upon this business.<br>
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:<br>
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:<br>
Most welcome home!<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</i><br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
This business is well ended.<br>
My liege, and madam, to expostulate<br>
What majesty should be, what duty is,<br>
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,<br>
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.<br>
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br>
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br>
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:<br>
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,<br>
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?<br>
But let that go.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
More matter, with less art.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.<br>
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;<br>
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;<br>
But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br>
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains<br>
That we find out the cause of this effect,<br>
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br>
For this effect defective comes by cause:<br>
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.<br>
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--<br>
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,<br>
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.<br>
<br>
<i>Reads</i><br>
<br>
'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most<br>
beautified Ophelia,'--<br>
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is<br>
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:<br>
<br>
<i>Reads</i><br>
<br>
'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Came this from Hamlet to her?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.<br>
<br>
<i>Reads</i><br>
<br>
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br>
Doubt that the sun doth move;<br>
Doubt truth to be a liar;<br>
But never doubt I love.<br>
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;<br>
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that<br>
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.<br>
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst<br>
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'<br>
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,<br>
And more above, hath his solicitings,<br>
As they fell out by time, by means and place,<br>
All given to mine ear.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
But how hath she<br>
Received his love?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
What do you think of me?<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
As of a man faithful and honourable.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,<br>
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--<br>
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,<br>
Before my daughter told me--what might you,<br>
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,<br>
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,<br>
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,<br>
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;<br>
What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br>
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br>
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;<br>
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,<br>
That she should lock herself from his resort,<br>
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br>
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;<br>
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--<br>
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,<br>
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,<br>
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,<br>
Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br>
And all we mourn for.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Do you think 'tis this?<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
It may be, very likely.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--<br>
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'<br>
When it proved otherwise?<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Not that I know.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
[Pointing to his head and shoulder]<br>
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:<br>
If circumstances lead me, I will find<br>
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed<br>
Within the centre.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
How may we try it further?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together<br>
Here in the lobby.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
So he does indeed.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:<br>
Be you and I behind an arras then;<br>
Mark the encounter: if he love her not<br>
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,<br>
Let me be no assistant for a state,<br>
But keep a farm and carters.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
We will try it.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Away, I do beseech you, both away:<br>
I'll board him presently.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants</i><br>
<br>
<i>Enter HAMLET, reading</i><br>
<br>
O, give me leave:<br>
How does my good Lord Hamlet?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Well, God-a-mercy.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Do you know me, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Not I, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Then I would you were so honest a man.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Honest, my lord!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be<br>
one man picked out of ten thousand.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
That's very true, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a<br>
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
I have, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a<br>
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.<br>
Friend, look to 't.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my<br>
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I<br>
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and<br>
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for<br>
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.<br>
What do you read, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Words, words, words.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
What is the matter, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Between who?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here<br>
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are<br>
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and<br>
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of<br>
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,<br>
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet<br>
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for<br>
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab<br>
you could go backward.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method<br>
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Into my grave.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Indeed, that is out o' the air.<br>
<br>
<i>Aside</i><br>
<br>
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness<br>
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity<br>
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will<br>
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of<br>
meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable<br>
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will<br>
more willingly part withal: except my life, except<br>
my life, except my life.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Fare you well, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
These tedious old fools!<br>
<br>
<i>Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</i><br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!<br>
<br>
<i>Exit POLONIUS</i><br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
My honoured lord!<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
My most dear lord!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,<br>
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
As the indifferent children of the earth.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;<br>
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Nor the soles of her shoe?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Neither, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of<br>
her favours?<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
'Faith, her privates we.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she<br>
is a strumpet. What's the news?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.<br>
Let me question more in particular: what have you,<br>
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,<br>
that she sends you to prison hither?<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
Prison, my lord!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Denmark's a prison.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Then is the world one.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,<br>
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
We think not so, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing<br>
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me<br>
it is a prison.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too<br>
narrow for your mind.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count<br>
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I<br>
have bad dreams.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very<br>
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
A dream itself is but a shadow.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a<br>
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and<br>
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we<br>
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN <br>
We'll wait upon you.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest<br>
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest<br>
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the<br>
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I<br>
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are<br>
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it<br>
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,<br>
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
What should we say, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent<br>
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks<br>
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:<br>
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
To what end, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by<br>
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of<br>
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved<br>
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could<br>
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,<br>
whether you were sent for, or no?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you<br>
love me, hold not off.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
My lord, we were sent for.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation<br>
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king<br>
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but<br>
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all<br>
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily<br>
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the<br>
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most<br>
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave<br>
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted<br>
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to<br>
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.<br>
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!<br>
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how<br>
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!<br>
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the<br>
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,<br>
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not<br>
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling<br>
you seem to say so.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what<br>
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from<br>
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they<br>
coming, to offer you service.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty<br>
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight<br>
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not<br>
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part<br>
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose<br>
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall<br>
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt<br>
for't. What players are they?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the<br>
tragedians of the city.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How chances it they travel? their residence, both<br>
in reputation and profit, was better both ways.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the<br>
late innovation.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was<br>
in the city? are they so followed?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
No, indeed, are they not.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How comes it? do they grow rusty?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but<br>
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,<br>
that cry out on the top of question, and are most<br>
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the<br>
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they<br>
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of<br>
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are<br>
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no<br>
longer than they can sing? will they not say<br>
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common<br>
players--as it is most like, if their means are no<br>
better--their writers do them wrong, to make them<br>
exclaim against their own succession?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and<br>
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to<br>
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid<br>
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to<br>
cuffs in the question.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Is't possible?<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Do the boys carry it away?<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of<br>
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while<br>
my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an<br>
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.<br>
'Sblood, there is something in this more than<br>
natural, if philosophy could find it out.<br>
<br>
<i>Flourish of trumpets within</i><br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
There are the players.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,<br>
come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion<br>
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,<br>
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,<br>
must show fairly outward, should more appear like<br>
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my<br>
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.<br>
<br>
GUILDENSTERN <br>
In what, my dear lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is<br>
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter POLONIUS</i><br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Well be with you, gentlemen!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a<br>
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet<br>
out of his swaddling-clouts.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they<br>
say an old man is twice a child.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;<br>
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;<br>
'twas so indeed.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
My lord, I have news to tell you.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
My lord, I have news to tell you.<br>
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
The actors are come hither, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Buz, buz!<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Upon mine honour,--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Then came each actor on his ass,--<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,<br>
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,<br>
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-<br>
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or<br>
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor<br>
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the<br>
liberty, these are the only men.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
What a treasure had he, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why,<br>
'One fair daughter and no more,<br>
The which he loved passing well.'<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
[Aside] Still on my daughter.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter<br>
that I love passing well.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Nay, that follows not.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
What follows, then, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why,<br>
'As by lot, God wot,'<br>
and then, you know,<br>
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--<br>
the first row of the pious chanson will show you<br>
more; for look, where my abridgement comes.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter four or five Players</i><br>
<br>
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad<br>
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old<br>
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:<br>
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young<br>
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is<br>
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the<br>
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like<br>
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the<br>
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en<br>
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:<br>
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste<br>
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.<br>
<br>
First Player <br>
What speech, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was<br>
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the<br>
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas<br>
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received<br>
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters<br>
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well<br>
digested in the scenes, set down with as much<br>
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there<br>
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter<br>
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might<br>
indict the author of affectation; but called it an<br>
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very<br>
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I<br>
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and<br>
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of<br>
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin<br>
at this line: let me see, let me see--<br>
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--<br>
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--<br>
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br>
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br>
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,<br>
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd<br>
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot<br>
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd<br>
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br>
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,<br>
That lend a tyrannous and damned light<br>
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,<br>
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,<br>
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br>
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'<br>
So, proceed you.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and<br>
good discretion.<br>
<br>
First Player <br>
'Anon he finds him<br>
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,<br>
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br>
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,<br>
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;<br>
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br>
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br>
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br>
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash<br>
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,<br>
Which was declining on the milky head<br>
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:<br>
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br>
And like a neutral to his will and matter,<br>
Did nothing.<br>
But, as we often see, against some storm,<br>
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br>
The bold winds speechless and the orb below<br>
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br>
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,<br>
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;<br>
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall<br>
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne<br>
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword<br>
Now falls on Priam.<br>
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,<br>
In general synod 'take away her power;<br>
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br>
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br>
As low as to the fiends!'<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
This is too long.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,<br>
say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he<br>
sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.<br>
<br>
First Player <br>
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
'The mobled queen?'<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.<br>
<br>
First Player <br>
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames<br>
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head<br>
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,<br>
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,<br>
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;<br>
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,<br>
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have<br>
pronounced:<br>
But if the gods themselves did see her then<br>
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport<br>
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,<br>
The instant burst of clamour that she made,<br>
Unless things mortal move them not at all,<br>
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,<br>
And passion in the gods.'<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has<br>
tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.<br>
Good my lord, will you see the players well<br>
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for<br>
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the<br>
time: after your death you were better have a bad<br>
epitaph than their ill report while you live.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man<br>
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?<br>
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less<br>
they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.<br>
Take them in.<br>
<br>
LORD POLONIUS <br>
Come, sirs.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First</i><br>
<br>
Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the<br>
Murder of Gonzago?<br>
<br>
First Player <br>
Ay, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,<br>
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which<br>
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?<br>
<br>
First Player <br>
Ay, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him<br>
not.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit First Player</i><br>
<br>
My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are<br>
welcome to Elsinore.<br>
<br>
ROSENCRANTZ <br>
Good my lord!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</i><br>
<br>
Now I am alone.<br>
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br>
Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br>
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br>
Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br>
That from her working all his visage wann'd,<br>
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,<br>
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br>
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!<br>
For Hecuba!<br>
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br>
That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br>
Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br>
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br>
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br>
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,<br>
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed<br>
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br>
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,<br>
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,<br>
Upon whose property and most dear life<br>
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br>
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br>
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?<br>
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,<br>
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?<br>
Ha!<br>
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br>
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall<br>
To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br>
I should have fatted all the region kites<br>
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!<br>
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br>
O, vengeance!<br>
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br>
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,<br>
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br>
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,<br>
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,<br>
A scullion!<br>
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard<br>
That guilty creatures sitting at a play<br>
Have by the very cunning of the scene<br>
Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;<br>
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players<br>
Play something like the murder of my father<br>
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;<br>
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br>
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>
May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br>
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br>
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>
As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds<br>
More relative than this: the play 's the thing<br>
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.<br>
<br>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Sharri Sarkisian's Guide to Angels</h5>
<img src="gfx/monsters/fallenangel.png" align="right" width="194" height="236" alt="Fallen Angel" />
<h6>Origins</h6>
<p>When Ki Ri Kashu died, creating The All - the universe we know today - he also gave birth to three children: Kaera, the goddess of beginnings, Rizi Vizi, the god of endings, and Gizubi, the god of life.</p>
<p>It was Kaera who created many of the laws that govern The All - such laws that we perceive as gravity and the speed of light.  And to help her maintain these laws Kaera also created the Angels, beings of radiance who epitomize the laws which they enforce.</p>
<h6>Appearance</h6>
<p>Though never seen directly by humans, Angels are almost unanimously depicted as winged females, often times wielding swords.  This imagery has been traced to Ancient writing, the sword image being consistent with Kaera, whose icon is the Edgeless Blade.  The reason behind the wings, however, is less clear.  Still, wings are cited as Angelic features in many Ancient writings.</p>
<p>Most interesting, however, is the female gender assigned to Angels.  As with the Gods themselves, individual Angels are never explicitly said to be male or female.  The feminine pronoun, however, is always used in association with Kaera and any of her creations, making stars, for example, feminine in Ancient script.  So while no individual Angel is said to be male or female, the word "Angel" is itself feminine, lending to the common imagery of female Angels.  Since nothing written directly contradicts this assumption it has entered tradition as fact.</p>
<h6>Fallen Angels</h6>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Angel's Choir</h6>
<p>The Ancients would sing a ceremonial song to ask for the blessings of the angels.  This was always done by candlelight, with 1 in every 3 candles being vanilla-scented, as it was believed that the angels enjoyed the scent of vanilla.</p>

<p>It is said that assaulting an Angel's domain - the law it protects - is the shortest path to Death (though only legendary mortals have found the power to even attempt to do so).  There are, however, some Angels who lose interest in their duty.  These so-called "Fallen Angels" are often stripped of their powers, if not outright killed, by Kaera, and forced to live mortal lives.</p>
<p>Gizubi is notable for leading many Angels astray, usually tempting them with an easy and carefree lifestyle.  While Kaera's punishments to Fallen Angels tend to be extreme, Angels that live out their lives with Gizubi are rarely noted to regret having done so.  Indeed, in many stories Fallen Angels are among the most spirited of Gizubi's host.</p>
<p>While Gizubi's interest in the Angels is hedonistic in its nature, Rizi Vizi actively seeks to harm Kaera by corrupting them.  Whether Rizi Vizi or Gizubi is more obtrusive to Kaera in this regard is a point of debate amongst some students of Ancient script.</p>

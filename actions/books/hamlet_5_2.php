SCENE II. A hall in the castle.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;<br>
You do remember all the circumstance?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Remember it, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,<br>
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay<br>
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,<br>
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,<br>
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,<br>
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us<br>
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,<br>
Rough-hew them how we will,--<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
That is most certain.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Up from my cabin,<br>
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark<br>
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.<br>
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew<br>
To mine own room again; making so bold,<br>
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal<br>
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--<br>
O royal knavery!--an exact command,<br>
Larded with many several sorts of reasons<br>
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,<br>
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,<br>
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,<br>
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,<br>
My head should be struck off.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Is't possible?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.<br>
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
I beseech you.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--<br>
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,<br>
They had begun the play--I sat me down,<br>
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:<br>
I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br>
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much<br>
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now<br>
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know<br>
The effect of what I wrote?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Ay, good my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
An earnest conjuration from the king,<br>
As England was his faithful tributary,<br>
As love between them like the palm might flourish,<br>
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear<br>
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,<br>
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,<br>
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,<br>
Without debatement further, more or less,<br>
He should the bearers put to sudden death,<br>
Not shriving-time allow'd.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
How was this seal'd?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.<br>
I had my father's signet in my purse,<br>
Which was the model of that Danish seal;<br>
Folded the writ up in form of the other,<br>
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,<br>
The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br>
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br>
Thou know'st already.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;<br>
They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br>
Does by their own insinuation grow:<br>
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br>
Between the pass and fell incensed points<br>
Of mighty opposites.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Why, what a king is this!<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--<br>
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,<br>
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,<br>
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,<br>
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,<br>
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,<br>
To let this canker of our nature come<br>
In further evil?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
It must be shortly known to him from England<br>
What is the issue of the business there.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
It will be short: the interim is mine;<br>
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'<br>
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,<br>
That to Laertes I forgot myself;<br>
For, by the image of my cause, I see<br>
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.<br>
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me<br>
Into a towering passion.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Peace! who comes here?<br>
<br>
<i>Enter OSRIC</i><br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
No, my good lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to<br>
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a<br>
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at<br>
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,<br>
spacious in the possession of dirt.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I<br>
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of<br>
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is<br>
northerly.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my<br>
complexion.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as<br>
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his<br>
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a<br>
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I beseech you, remember--<br>
<br>
<i>HAMLET moves him to put on his hat</i><br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.<br>
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe<br>
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent<br>
differences, of very soft society and great showing:<br>
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or<br>
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the<br>
continent of what part a gentleman would see.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;<br>
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would<br>
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw<br>
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the<br>
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of<br>
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and<br>
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his<br>
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace<br>
him, his umbrage, nothing more.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman<br>
in our more rawer breath?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Sir?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?<br>
You will do't, sir, really.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Of Laertes?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Of him, sir.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
I know you are not ignorant--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,<br>
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with<br>
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to<br>
know himself.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation<br>
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What's his weapon?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Rapier and dagger.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
That's two of his weapons: but, well.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary<br>
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take<br>
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their<br>
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the<br>
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very<br>
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,<br>
and of very liberal conceit.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What call you the carriages?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we<br>
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might<br>
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses<br>
against six French swords, their assigns, and three<br>
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet<br>
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes<br>
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you<br>
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it<br>
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship<br>
would vouchsafe the answer.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How if I answer 'no'?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his<br>
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let<br>
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the<br>
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;<br>
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
I commend my duty to your lordship.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Yours, yours.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit OSRIC</i><br>
<br>
He does well to commend it himself; there are no<br>
tongues else for's turn.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.<br>
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I<br>
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of<br>
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of<br>
yesty collection, which carries them through and<br>
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do<br>
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter a Lord</i><br>
<br>
Lord <br>
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young<br>
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in<br>
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to<br>
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's<br>
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now<br>
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.<br>
<br>
Lord <br>
The king and queen and all are coming down.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
In happy time.<br>
<br>
Lord <br>
The queen desires you to use some gentle<br>
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
She well instructs me.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit Lord</i><br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
You will lose this wager, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I do not think so: since he went into France, I<br>
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the<br>
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here<br>
about my heart: but it is no matter.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Nay, good my lord,--<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of<br>
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will<br>
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not<br>
fit.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special<br>
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,<br>
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be<br>
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the<br>
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he<br>
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?<br>
<br>
<i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c</i><br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.<br>
<br>
<i>KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;<br>
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.<br>
This presence knows,<br>
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd<br>
With sore distraction. What I have done,<br>
That might your nature, honour and exception<br>
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<br>
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:<br>
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,<br>
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,<br>
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<br>
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,<br>
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;<br>
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.<br>
Sir, in this audience,<br>
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil<br>
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,<br>
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,<br>
And hurt my brother.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
I am satisfied in nature,<br>
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most<br>
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour<br>
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,<br>
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,<br>
I have a voice and precedent of peace,<br>
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,<br>
I do receive your offer'd love like love,<br>
And will not wrong it.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I embrace it freely;<br>
And will this brother's wager frankly play.<br>
Give us the foils. Come on.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Come, one for me.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance<br>
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,<br>
Stick fiery off indeed.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
You mock me, sir.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
No, by this hand.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,<br>
You know the wager?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Very well, my lord<br>
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:<br>
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
This is too heavy, let me see another.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?<br>
<br>
<i>They prepare to play</i><br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Ay, my good lord.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.<br>
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,<br>
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,<br>
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:<br>
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;<br>
And in the cup an union shall he throw,<br>
Richer than that which four successive kings<br>
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;<br>
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,<br>
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,<br>
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,<br>
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:<br>
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Come on, sir.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Come, my lord.<br>
<br>
<i>They play</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
One.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
No.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Judgment.<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
A hit, a very palpable hit.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Well; again.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;<br>
Here's to thy health.<br>
<br>
<i>Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within</i><br>
<br>
Give him the cup.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.<br>
<br>
<i>They play</i><br>
<br>
Another hit; what say you?<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
A touch, a touch, I do confess.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Our son shall win.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
He's fat, and scant of breath.<br>
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;<br>
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Good madam!<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Gertrude, do not drink.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
[Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Come, let me wipe thy face.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
My lord, I'll hit him now.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
I do not think't.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
[Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;<br>
I pray you, pass with your best violence;<br>
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Say you so? come on.<br>
<br>
<i>They play</i><br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Nothing, neither way.<br>

LAERTES <br>
Have at you now!<br>
<br>
<i>LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES</i><br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Part them; they are incensed.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Nay, come, again.<br>
<br>
<i>QUEEN GERTRUDE falls</i><br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Look to the queen there, ho!<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
How is't, Laertes?<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;<br>
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How does the queen?<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
She swounds to see them bleed.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--<br>
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.<br>
<br>
<i>Dies</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:<br>
Treachery! Seek it out.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;<br>
No medicine in the world can do thee good;<br>
In thee there is not half an hour of life;<br>
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,<br>
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise<br>
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,<br>
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:<br>
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
The point!--envenom'd too!<br>
Then, venom, to thy work.<br>
<br>
<i>Stabs KING CLAUDIUS</i><br>
<br>
All <br>
Treason! treason!<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,<br>
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?<br>
Follow my mother.<br>
<br>
<i>KING CLAUDIUS dies</i><br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
He is justly served;<br>
It is a poison temper'd by himself.<br>
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:<br>
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,<br>
Nor thine on me.<br>
<br>
Dies<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.<br>
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!<br>
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,<br>
That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br>
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,<br>
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--<br>
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;<br>
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright<br>
To the unsatisfied.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Never believe it:<br>
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:<br>
Here's yet some liquor left.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
As thou'rt a man,<br>
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.<br>
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,<br>
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!<br>
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart<br>
Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br>
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br>
To tell my story.<br>
<br>
<i>March afar off, and shot within</i><br>
<br>
What warlike noise is this?<br>
<br>
OSRIC <br>
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,<br>
To the ambassadors of England gives<br>
This warlike volley.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
O, I die, Horatio;<br>
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:<br>
I cannot live to hear the news from England;<br>
But I do prophesy the election lights<br>
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;<br>
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,<br>
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.<br>
<br>
<i>Dies</i><br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:<br>
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!<br>
Why does the drum come hither?<br>
<br>
<i>March within</i><br>
<br>
<i>Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others</i><br>
<br>
PRINCE FORTINBRAS <br>
Where is this sight?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
What is it ye would see?<br>
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.<br>
<br>
PRINCE FORTINBRAS <br>
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,<br>
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,<br>
That thou so many princes at a shot<br>
So bloodily hast struck?<br>
<br>
First Ambassador <br>
The sight is dismal;<br>
And our affairs from England come too late:<br>
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,<br>
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,<br>
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:<br>
Where should we have our thanks?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Not from his mouth,<br>
Had it the ability of life to thank you:<br>
He never gave commandment for their death.<br>
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br>
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,<br>
Are here arrived give order that these bodies<br>
High on a stage be placed to the view;<br>
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world<br>
How these things came about: so shall you hear<br>
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,<br>
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,<br>
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,<br>
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br>
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I<br>
Truly deliver.<br>
<br>
PRINCE FORTINBRAS <br>
Let us haste to hear it,<br>
And call the noblest to the audience.<br>
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:<br>
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,<br>
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,<br>
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;<br>
But let this same be presently perform'd,<br>
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance<br>
On plots and errors, happen.<br>
<br>
PRINCE FORTINBRAS <br>
Let four captains<br>
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;<br>
For he was likely, had he been put on,<br>
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,<br>
The soldiers' music and the rites of war<br>
Speak loudly for him.<br>
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this<br>
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.<br>
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.<br>
<br>
<i>A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off</i><br>

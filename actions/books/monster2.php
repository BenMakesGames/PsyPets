<h5><img src="gfx/pets/eyeonlegs.png" align="left" alt="" />Ambling Eye</h5>
<p>The origins of the Ambling Eye is unclear, but it is most likely an artificial creation given this startling trait: anyone who touches an Ambling Eye can see what it sees for a duration afterwards.  The longer you're in direct contact with an Ambling Eye, the longer you gain its visual perception.  The experience is disorienting at first, but with practice can be used easily and naturally.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/cottoncandy.png" align="left" alt="" />Cotton Candy</h5>
<p>There is no scientific explanation for this creature's existence, only a strange story - involving a pyromaniac chef-magi, his pet Robot Monkey, and a werewolf attack at a sugar cane grove - which is largely regarded as pure fiction.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/thoughts.gif" align="left" alt="" />Manifestation of Dark, Secretive Thoughts</h5>
<p>A creature of mythology: dark and secretive thoughts are said to manifest themselves, appearing in the least desirable fashion before those you wish to hide them from the most.  For this reason, it is said, you should not harbor such thoughts.</p>
<p>The creature by this name is not, of course, a phantom of any kind, however it's intricate coloration is often attributed as being "hypnotic" or "psychedelic" and earned it its name.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/raccoon.gif" align="left" alt="" />Raccoon</h5>
<p>This is the very same Raccoon that we find on Earth's surface.  It has no doubt found its way to the Hollow Earth using the same means with which it is able to find its way into your trash can despite your every efforts to keep it out.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/lionesque.gif" align="left" alt="" />Red-Tailed Lion</h5>
<p>This strange breed of lion uses its bright and colorful tail to great effect.  For hunting, the lion hides itself in a tree or bush, dangling its tail in order to lure birds and insects that mistake it for a Delicious fruit.  In a fight, quick flicks of the bright tail distract the enemy, giving the Red-Tailed Lion a chance to strike.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/rock.gif" align="left" alt="" />Rock</h5>
<p>Rocks are strange creatures, resting on the edges of pools in order to grow patches of moss, which they then roll on to and devour.  They do this at regular intervals, hibernating in the interim, during which time they are virtually indistinguishable from normal rocks.</p>
<p>In captivity Rocks are much more active, often rolling from place to place and completely unable to grow any moss.  They must therefore be fed, usually by smearing the food on their surfaces.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/sooty.gif" align="left" alt="" />Sooty</h5>
<p>Sooties often dwell in dark corners where dust collects, such as abandoned houses or factories.  They are skittish, but easily coaxed with sweet candies.</p>
<p>Great care must be taken when handling a Sooty, as they are very fragile.  Even a strong gust of wind could blow one apart.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/mtelephant.png" align="left" alt="" />Tiny Elephant</h5>
<p>Tiny Elephants are naturally herd creatures, traveling great distances to sites of meteor impacts, volcanic eruptions and even earthquakes for reasons still beyond our understanding.  They are hated by Tree Mice, who ambush any unfortunate enough to pass under their trees.</p>
<p>Whether the Tiny Elephant is, in fact, a tiny version of the common Elephant, or the Elephant's predecessor is unknown.</p>

SCENE I. A churchyard.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c</i><br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that<br>
wilfully seeks her own salvation?<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave<br>
straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it<br>
Christian burial.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her<br>
own defence?<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Why, 'tis found so.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For<br>
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,<br>
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it<br>
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned<br>
herself wittingly.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here<br>
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,<br>
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he<br>
goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him<br>
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he<br>
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
But is this law?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been<br>
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'<br>
Christian burial.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that<br>
great folk should have countenance in this world to<br>
drown or hang themselves, more than their even<br>
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient<br>
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:<br>
they hold up Adam's profession.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Was he a gentleman?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
He was the first that ever bore arms.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Why, he had none.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the<br>
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'<br>
could he dig without arms? I'll put another<br>
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the<br>
purpose, confess thyself--<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Go to.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
What is he that builds stronger than either the<br>
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a<br>
thousand tenants.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows<br>
does well; but how does it well? it does well to<br>
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the<br>
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,<br>
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or<br>
a carpenter?'<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Marry, now I can tell.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
To't.<br>
<br>
Second Clown <br>
Mass, I cannot tell.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance</i><br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull<br>
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when<br>
you are asked this question next, say 'a<br>
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till<br>
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a<br>
stoup of liquor.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit Second Clown</i><br>
<br>
<i>He digs and sings</i><br>
<br>
In youth, when I did love, did love,<br>
Methought it was very sweet,<br>
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,<br>
O, methought, there was nothing meet.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he<br>
sings at grave-making?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath<br>
the daintier sense.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
<i>Sings</i><br>
<br>
But age, with his stealing steps,<br>
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,<br>
And hath shipped me intil the land,<br>
As if I had never been such.<br>
<br>
<i>Throws up a skull</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:<br>
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were<br>
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It<br>
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass<br>
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,<br>
might it not?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
It might, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,<br>
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might<br>
be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord<br>
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Ay, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and<br>
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:<br>
here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to<br>
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,<br>
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
<i>Sings</i><br>
<br>
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,<br>
For and a shrouding sheet:<br>
O, a pit of clay for to be made<br>
For such a guest is meet.<br>
<br>
<i>Throws up another skull</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a<br>
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,<br>
his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he<br>
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the<br>
sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of<br>
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be<br>
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,<br>
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,<br>
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and<br>
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine<br>
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him<br>
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than<br>
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The<br>
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in<br>
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Not a jot more, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance<br>
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose<br>
grave's this, sirrah?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Mine, sir.<br>
<br>
<i>Sings</i><br>
<br>
O, a pit of clay for to be made<br>
For such a guest is meet.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not<br>
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:<br>
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to<br>
you.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What man dost thou dig it for?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
For no man, sir.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What woman, then?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
For none, neither.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Who is to be buried in't?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the<br>
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,<br>
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of<br>
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the<br>
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he<br>
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a<br>
grave-maker?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day<br>
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How long is that since?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it<br>
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that<br>
is mad, and sent into England.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits<br>
there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men<br>
are as mad as he.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How came he mad?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Very strangely, they say.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How strangely?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Upon what ground?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man<br>
and boy, thirty years.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we<br>
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce<br>
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year<br>
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why he more than another?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that<br>
he will keep out water a great while; and your water<br>
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.<br>
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth<br>
three and twenty years.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Whose was it?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Nay, I know not.<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a<br>
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,<br>
sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
This?<br>
<br>
First Clown <br>
E'en that.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Let me see.<br>
<br>
<i>Takes the skull</i><br>
<br>
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow<br>
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath<br>
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how<br>
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at<br>
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know<br>
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your<br>
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,<br>
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one<br>
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?<br>
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let<br>
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must<br>
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell<br>
me one thing.<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
What's that, my lord?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'<br>
the earth?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
E'en so.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
And smelt so? pah!<br>
<br>
<i>Puts down the skull</i><br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
E'en so, my lord.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may<br>
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,<br>
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with<br>
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as<br>
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,<br>
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of<br>
earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he<br>
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?<br>
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,<br>
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:<br>
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,<br>
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!<br>
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.<br>
<br>
<i>Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c</i><br>
<br>
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?<br>
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken<br>
The corse they follow did with desperate hand<br>
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.<br>
Couch we awhile, and mark.<br>
<br>
<i>Retiring with HORATIO</i><br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
What ceremony else?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
That is Laertes,<br>
A very noble youth: mark.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
What ceremony else?<br>
<br>
First Priest <br>
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged<br>
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;<br>
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,<br>
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged<br>
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,<br>
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;<br>
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,<br>
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home<br>
Of bell and burial.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Must there no more be done?<br>
<br>
First Priest <br>
No more be done:<br>
We should profane the service of the dead<br>
To sing a requiem and such rest to her<br>
As to peace-parted souls.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
Lay her i' the earth:<br>
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh<br>
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,<br>
A ministering angel shall my sister be,<br>
When thou liest howling.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
What, the fair Ophelia!<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!<br>
<br>
<i>Scattering flowers</i><br>
<br>
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;<br>
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,<br>
And not have strew'd thy grave.<br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
O, treble woe<br>
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,<br>
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense<br>
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,<br>
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:<br>
<br>
<i>Leaps into the grave</i><br>
<br>
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,<br>
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,<br>
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head<br>
Of blue Olympus.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
[Advancing] What is he whose grief<br>
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow<br>
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand<br>
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,<br>
Hamlet the Dane.<br>
<br>
<i>Leaps into the grave</i><br>
<br>
LAERTES <br>
The devil take thy soul!<br>
<br>
<i>Grappling with him</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Thou pray'st not well.<br>
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;<br>
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,<br>
Yet have I something in me dangerous,<br>
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
Pluck them asunder.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
Hamlet, Hamlet!<br>
<br>
All <br>
Gentlemen,--<br>
<br>
HORATIO <br>
Good my lord, be quiet.<br>
<br>
<i>The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave</i><br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Why I will fight with him upon this theme<br>
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
O my son, what theme?<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers<br>
Could not, with all their quantity of love,<br>
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?<br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
O, he is mad, Laertes.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
For love of God, forbear him.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:<br>
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?<br>
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?<br>
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?<br>
To outface me with leaping in her grave?<br>
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:<br>
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw<br>
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,<br>
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,<br>
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,<br>
I'll rant as well as thou.<br>
<br>
QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>
This is mere madness:<br>
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;<br>
Anon, as patient as the female dove,<br>
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,<br>
His silence will sit drooping.<br>
<br>
HAMLET <br>
Hear you, sir;<br>
What is the reason that you use me thus?<br>
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;<br>
Let Hercules himself do what he may,<br>
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit</i><br>
<br>
KING CLAUDIUS <br>
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.<br>
<br>
<i>Exit HORATIO</i><br>
<br>
<i>To LAERTES</i><br>
<br>
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;<br>
We'll put the matter to the present push.<br>
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.<br>
This grave shall have a living monument:<br>
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;<br>
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.<br>
<br>
<i>Exeunt</i><br>

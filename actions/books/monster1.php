<h5><img src="gfx/pets/odd_flying_thing.gif" align="left" alt="" />Avy</h5>
<p>As cute as it is fast, the Avy soars the skies of the Hollow Earth.  It is fascinated by all things shiny, include its favorite food, fish, which it can spot from a great distance.  By the time one dies of old age, an Avy typically possess a formidable hoard hidden inside its cave-nest.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/eyyyyyes.png" align="left" alt="" />Beholden</h5>
<p>This creature is not named for its resemblance to the mythological creature of the same name, but rather because it is believed to be that very creature!  No doubt one of these escaped to Earth long ago, causing numerous, terrifying stories to be told about it and its origins.  In truth, the Beholden is an herbivorous prey animal, its many eyes looking out for predators while it eats.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/the_bones.gif" align="left" alt="" />The Bones</h5>
<p>A voracious, carnivorous monotreme, the Bones is at the top of the food chain, though for some reason shows a particular aversion to Desikh.  Indeed, The Bones will commonly avoid unguarded clutches of baby Desikh in favor of other Desikh-predators.  By this way, Desikh and The Bones have over the course of history formed a strange symbiotic relationship.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/broccoli.gif" align="left" alt="" />Broccoli</h5>
<p>There are many plants in the Hollow Earth which have gained incredible motility, and intelligence, despite retaining most of their plant features: reproduction by pollination, photosynthesis, etc.  The Broccoli is a particularly notable example, as it is has also retained its distinct flavor.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/desikh.gif" align="left" alt="" />Desikh</h5>
<p>Though a generally mellow creature, the Desikh is the dominant creature in the Hollow Earth.  It subsists mainly on nuts and berries, but has been known to consume meat when it is readily available.  That is, it is an omnivore, but a lazy one.</p>
<p>Desikh come in many colors, the most common of which by far is a shade of blue.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/fountain_tail.gif" align="left" alt="" />Fountain-Tailed Cat</h5>
<p>The Fountain-Tailed Cat is unmistakably related to the Striped Leopard.  Unlike its cousin, however, this cat features a split tail.  Every Fountain-Tailed Cat has a unique tail structure, defined by the number, and placement, of the splits, which provides as a means of identification.  The tail also plays a prominent role in mating rituals.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/frog.gif" align="left" alt="" />Frog</h5>
<p>Frogs of the Hollow Earth are very similar to the frogs we find on the surface.  Their striking resemblance to rocks makes them difficult even for the trained eye to identify.  Taking this disguise for granted, however, many frogs have met untimely ends at the hands of those who mistake them for rocks up until the terminal squish.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/monsters/robotmonkey.png" align="left" alt="" />Robot Monkey</h5>
<p>Robot Monkeys, though not living organisms, deserve a spot in this book.  They are capable of constructing new Robot Monkeys, the supplies for which they spend their functional lives collecting.  This reproduction is often performed imperfectly, leading to a sort of evolution of the "species."</p>
<p>When, or by whom, they were initially constructed is unknown.</p>
<h5><img src="gfx/pets/treemouse.png" align="left" alt="" />Tree Mouse</h5>
<p>This curious creature is known for burrowing in the root structures of trees.  It leaves its unique ears, which are perched on stalks, sticking just above the ground as it sleeps.  Small insects that stray too close, attracted by the bright colorations inside these ears, wake the Tree Mouse, which, in a swift movement, consumes the unfortunate bug.</p>

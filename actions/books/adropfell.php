by Emily Dickinson<br />
<br />
A drop fell on the apple tree<br />
Another on the roof;<br />
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,<br />
And made the gables laugh.<br />
<br />
A few went out to help the brook,<br />
That went to help the sea.<br />
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,<br />
What necklaces could be!<br />
<br />
The dust replaced in hoisted roa<br />
The birds jocoser sung;<br />
The sunshine threw his hat away,<br />
The orchards spangles hung.<br />
<br />
The breezes brought dejected<br />
And bathed them in the glee;<br />
The East put out a single flag,<br />
And signed the fete away.
